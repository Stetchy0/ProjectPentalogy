Abaddon is the concept of balance. He isn't necessarily a force specifically for good, though in many cases, is it observed that way, since chaos brings about rampant destruction at its every appearance. He is mentioned in the [[Part 0 - Prolegomenon]], but is introduced to the story in [[Part V - Balance]].

Alex evolves to be Abaddon, to protect the [[singularity]], [[Persephone]], as she is at the center of the scale between the two planes of existence.

Abaddon's home realm is [[Closer Earth|closer earth]], however, his abilities are not tethered to one dimension like [[Dami|Mephisto]]'s.
