S is [[Antoinette]]'s girlfriend and a victim to constant abuse. She was the first appointed general due to Antoinette being attracted to her, and she was told that others would kill her if they knew about their relationship. She is deeply distrustful toward the other [[Black Crusaders]] and has a reputation of lashing out and being cruel. 

She was born in [[! Farther Earth|farther earth]].

With Antoinette being pretty absent and distant for most of [[Loki]]â€™s early childhood, Seraphine took on the role of helping raise her and read bed time stories to her. One of those stories was Romeo and Juliet.

General [[Fox]] is the only one she feels safe confiding in, for the panic attack she witnessed humanized him to her.
When the two get closer, she decides she wants to try to talk to the other ranks and prove that she is more than the sadistic idea they have of her. 

She is terrified of [[Bunny]] because he once kidnapped and threatened to kill a kitten she took in. 

There is tension between Seraphine  and [[Green]], as she has no idea Green is in love with Antoinette until she is cheated on.
