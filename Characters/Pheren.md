Pheren is the [[synthetic demon]] that inhabits [[Felix]]'s body, and would be the only synthetic demon to ever truly co-inhabit a body, rather than completely taking it over and manipulating the user or being killed by the user. This is because of Felix's sleep condition. Because of Felix's Narcolepsy, he had better control of his mind and dream state than anyone else and could directly communicate with Pheren. No other synthetic demon transplant has or ever will be able to accomplish this perfect symbiosis.
