Antoinette Ivanov is the successor to the [[Black Crusaders]] after the death of her parents, [[Natz]] and [[Estelle]], and the fall of [[Lee]] and [[Vi]]. 

Shortly after rising to power, she mothered an abandoned baby boy and named the possible heir Logan Ivanov. However, Logan comes out as transgender, and becomes [[Loki]]. This tarnishes Antoinette’s idea of having a “perfect” child, and she takes out Loki’s eye and exiles her for a year. During this expulsion, Loki meets and befriends [[Persephone]].

Antoinette is also [[S]]’s girlfriend, though abuser would be a more fitting word. Due to the drastic power imbalance between the two, Antoinette pressures and coerces S into situations she does not want to be in. Antoinette constantly gives S the false hope that they will be more than just a sexual relationship, and consistently guilts her if she defies her. S is desperate for Antoinette’s love because she was manipulated into fearing and pushing away her other comrades. S feels she has no one to trust, and her unresolved traumas manifest into anger that scares the other crusaders. Thus, Antoinette has effectively trapped S in this abusive relationship, and due to being a monarch, has the power to demote or punish her if she doesn’t follow her wishes.

To make matters worse, she leads on [[Green]] and eventually cheats on S with her, pitting the two against each other to fight for her affection. 

Despite being a cold and terrifying leader, it is her lust for riches, disorganization, and cruelty that leads to all of the surviving generals to give up their loyalty. As a result, no one mourns her once she is beheaded by [[Aiko]].
