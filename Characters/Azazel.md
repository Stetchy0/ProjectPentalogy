Azazel is the only [[Synthetic Nymph]] who was able to manifest a physical form outside of its owner's body, and become a completely separate entity from its owner, [[Jace]]. He was in cahoots with Vi and Natz during [[Natz's Coup D'Ã©tat]]. He was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]]. He is introduced in [[Part I - Experience]].

This anomalous reaction to the injection can be considered the opposite of [[Pherenix]]'s, because this was caused by severe insomnia rather than narcolepsy.
