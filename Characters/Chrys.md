Chrysanthemum Corday has the [[synthetic demon]] of a deer, hence the antlers on his head and the tuffs of hair that appear to look like ears. 

Chrys used to be a ruthless general of the [[Black Crusaders]] until his sister, [[Charlotte Corday]], murdered General [[Lavender]], the brother they grew up with. 

His refusal to execute his sister led to his imprisonment. Though he escaped, being on the run guaranteed he would never live a normal life. 

His distress made him vulnerable to being possessed by a vengeful poltergeist, who turns him into a small fox, powerless and weak.

In an impulsive attempt to kill the other generals (along with himself), he accidentally opens a portal to [[Closer Earth]].
