Enemy and fugitive of the [[Black Crusaders]]. 

Chrysanthemum Corday has attributes of a deer to his encounter with a  [[synthetic demon]], hence the antlers on his head and the tuffs of hair that appear to look like ears. He is one of the only individuals to outsmart and overpower his injected demon, the only other individual being Connor.

Chrys used to be a ruthless general of the [[Black Crusaders]] until his sister, [[Charlotte Corday]], murdered General [[Lavender]], the brother they grew up with. 

His refusal to execute his sister led to his imprisonment. Though he escaped, being on the run guaranteed he would never live a normal life. 

His distress made him vulnerable to being possessed by a vengeful poltergeist, who turns him into a small fox, powerless and weak.

In an impulsive attempt to kill the other generals (along with himself), he accidentally opens a portal to [[Closer Earth]], leading to all of the conflict in the latter 3 parts of the pentalogy.
