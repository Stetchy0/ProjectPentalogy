Enemy and fugitive of the [[Black Crusaders]]. He was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]]. He was introduced in [[Part 0.11 - Desertion]].

Chrysanthemum Corday has attributes of a deer to his encounter with a  [[Synthetic Nymph]], hence the antlers on his head and the tuffs of hair that appear to look like ears. He is one of the only individuals to outsmart and overpower his injected Nymph, the only other individual being [[Connor]].

Chrys used to be a ruthless general of the [[Black Crusaders]] until his sister, [[Charlotte Corday]], murdered General [[Lavender]], the brother they grew up with. 

His refusal to execute his sister led to his imprisonment. Though he escaped, being on the run guaranteed he would never live a normal life. 

Chrys also had very loose rebel ties because he was so disturbed by the sight of a kid with a missing eye tied up in a cellar. He told the rebels only this information in order to make himself feel better about his inaction. However, [[Loki]] remembers and resents him greatly. 

His distress from being hunted and in constant pain made him vulnerable to being possessed by a vengeful poltergeist, who turns him into a small fox, powerless and weak.

In an impulsive attempt to kill the other generals (along with himself), he accidentally opens a portal to [[Closer Earth|closer earth]], leading to all of the conflict in the latter 3 parts of the pentalogy.
