[[Aiko]]'s girlfriend (chaos ensues)

[[Persephone]]'s childhood friend and lifetime companion

An outgoing and chaotic arsonist who starts as a villain, and becomes a friend and loved one of those she was supposed to fight against, [[Project Hope Effect]].

She was born in [[! Farther Earth|farther earth]].

Born as a boy, distantly raised by [[Antoinette]], and originally intended to be her heir to the [[Black Crusaders]]. This plan gets complicated once Loki realizes sheâ€™s trans, and asks [[Green]] to dye her hair pink. This causes Antoinette to have a tweakfest, trying to dismantle the idea that Logan Ivanov could ever be a girl.

Loki is forced to give up her freedom and status in exchange for the safety of Project Hope Effect. This leads to a series of events the results in Loki dueling Antoinette, and Aiko tipping the balance of their final fight.
