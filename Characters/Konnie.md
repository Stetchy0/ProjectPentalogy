Konnie Ellis is what you’d call a confusing case. As a student, she’s sweet, amiable, and extroverted. But as a hero, she’s straight up snarky, rude, arrogant, and overall acts more like a diva. She is friendly with [[Emira]] and [[Amber|Amy]], but makes jabs at [[Aiko]], [[Moyo]], and [[Loki]]. She was born in [[Closer Earth|closer earth]]. She was introduced in [[Part III - Hope]].

Konnie is especially harsh on Aiko because Aiko seemingly wants to disobey [[Chrys]]. Konnie is the only one who’s encountered a genuinely malicious crusader - [[Bunny]] - stalking her and following her home. Chrys had promised to help get to the bottom of her issue, and he feels she’s the only one who gets how serious this could be.

Konnie is obsessed with blowing up on social media without people figuring out who her big name parents are, and has deleted and remade accounts. She gets her big break when she and [[Kira]] collaborate on account for her hero persona, “Lotus”. 

Konnie has been neglected by her family. It is eventually revealed that she is actually deaf and she doesn’t like certain activities because she’s afraid of losing her hearing aids. Her parents treat her disability as insignificant because she has access to aid, and it frustrates the hell out of her, causing her to commonly lash out at others. Both how she acts as a student and as a hero are facades for positive or negative attention. Her true personality is something in between. 

Element: Earth 

Her ability is telepathy, or reading the emotions of those she chooses. When mastered, it could be used to influence the emotions of another, but for now, it’s there to compensate for Konnie’s lack of empathy. She thinks this ability is lame.
