Kieran, also known as [[Kiki]], is Natz and Sierra's son, though he would never meet his parents. He was born in [[! Farther Earth|farther earth]]. He was next in line for leadership after [[Antoinette]], his sister, though he would never care to look into why he was next in line.

He would be with the Black Crusaders from birth until he ends up adopted by [[Moyo]] and [[Chieko]] while trying to work undercover. His discovery of empathy and love from the hope group would cut him off from the crusaders. He left no one else in line or had a backup, so his best friend in the crusaders, [[Dami]] became the de facto leader. 

While he was in the crusaders, he had a love interest in Dami, however, Dami never came out of the closet, or even considered love at all, as he was always too busy scheming his "bigger plan."
