Zayne was found by [[Kieran]] in [[Siverial]] while he was scouting. They were pickpocketing people with ease and living off of scraps. Kieran could sense they had significant abilities, and he was correct. They were born in [[! Farther Earth|farther earth]].

Zayne has the ability to hear certain thoughts. They can look into other people's minds, however, it is a very, very difficult and draining task to perform. He offered them a home and food in exchange for research on their amazing and unique ability, and eventually reconnaissance work. Zayne happily agreed, and became a Black Crusader, simply for the fun of it.

It was only a few months after they joined that they would begin to go out on common missions, just to help out, since numbers were getting smaller and smaller. This is where they would meet [[Bee]] for the first time. 

On a mission like any other, they were raiding and destroying a village for people and supplies. Zayne's abilities had become more honed with practice and the use of [[Anthracyllin]]. They sensed someone with unbearable pain nearby, so much pain that they couldn't help but weep with them. They found Beth, tied up in a barn they had set alight already, now screaming for help. Her head was bleeding badly. Zayne took their clothes off to give to her and rushed back to base, carrying Beth the entire way.

While she carried her, though, physical contact allowed them to see much more clearly inside her memories. Zayne, who was aloof and indifferent for their entire life, felt rage for the first time. They helped Beth tend to her wounds before setting back out to kill the man who hurt Beth.

They would hunt him down, as he had escaped the Crusaders' raid, and make a display of wrath from his tortured body in the streets of Siverial, where he fled, before returning back to the base. (See [[Mr. Berry's Demise]])
