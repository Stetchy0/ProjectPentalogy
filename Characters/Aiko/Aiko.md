Aiko is [[Loki]]'s girlfriend and the main protagonist of [[Part III - Hope|Project: Hope Effect]]. She was born in [[Closer Earth|closer earth]]. She is introduced in [[Part III - Hope]].

She is the last human [[Chrys]] gives abilities to, approached unexpectedly when the rest of [[Project Hope Effect|Team Hope]] struggles to fight and apprehend Loki. 

Aiko makes her debut as a hero by defeating Loki in the first fight of the comic. However, she at first tried to talk things out with the disrupter. Aiko offered out her hand, and asked Loki if she wanted to be friends. When Loki refused and attacked, Aiko only responded in self defense. Loki still remembered this interaction days later, and asked Aiko if they could meet on the rooftop and chat. Loki warned Aiko that [[Chrys]] is hiding something, and the trust between the two grew because Aiko didn’t immediately dismiss what she had to say. As a result, the two began to meet in secret at this building top every night, going on their own adventures and whatnot. In Act I, they stargaze, play music, and Loki convinces Aiko to commit minimal misdemeanors while Aiko tries to get Loki to quit breaking the law.

Ironically, it is her eventual secret friendship with Loki that slowly sparks the downfall of [[Antoinette]].

Aiko is an awkward outcast who is failing every class, yet she remains an extremely caring and moral individual. She is childhood friends with [[Emira]], and becomes close with [[Moyo]] and [[Chieko]]. 

Aiko has accepted her parents’ divorce, but is heartbroken about losing the life she used to know a year ago. She misses her guitar, her telescope, her room, etc. 

Element: Lightning 

Her power is speed to compensate for her “slowness” and her struggle to process information the same way other students do. (She canonically has ADHD)

Aiko is the one who ends up beheading [[Antoinette]] in order to save Loki.
