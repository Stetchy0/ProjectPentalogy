Moyo is [[Chieko|Chi]]'s partner. They/them

Moyo is a non-binary student who was severely bullied for coming out, and unfortunately kicked out by their conservative parents. They live in their brother’s apartment, and work in the city to help pay rent. 

Before they had a secure place to stay, Chieko would let them sleepover for a bit. They were already friends for a long time, but Chieko’s kindness is what elevated their friendship and lead Moyo to develop feelings for her.

Moyo is aloof, standoffish, intimidating, and typically avoids people, but Chieko is the person they feel happiest with and want to always be around. 

Having that one good friend does wonders, but it unfortunately doesn’t stop the extreme anxiety and depression Moyo suffers from. To cope, they drink, smoke, and handle their prescription irresponsibly. 

Element: Wind

They have the power of extreme strength to compensate for their inability to fight their drug addiction.
