Connor Smith, originally born Carter Smith in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]], introduced in [[Part I - Experience]], is one of many of the [[Black Crusaders]]'s experiments, and arguably one of their most successful despite being one of the main factors leading to the organization's downfall. He is also one of the thousands of [[Kidnapped]], but one of the few that survive the crusaders. Connor's synthetic nymph is a snake, whom he overpowers in his mind and takes its abilities as his own. He is one of very few who have overcome their [[Synthetic Nymph]], the only other one being [[Chrys]].
