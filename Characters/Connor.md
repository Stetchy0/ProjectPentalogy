Connor's #syntheticdemon is a snake, whom he overpowers in his mind and takes its abilities as his own. He is one of very few who have overcome their [[Synthetic Demon]].

Connor Smith, originally born Carter Smith, is one of many of the [[Black Crusaders]]'s experiments, and arguably one of their most successful despite being one of the main factors leading to the organization's downfall.

Connor is [[Pherenix|Felix]]'s brother. He, Felix, and [[Lee|Leo]] were all kidnapped simultaneously by [[Marx]] and [[Natz]]. ([[Black Crusaders]])
