Serana Mariposa is the child of popular actress and model, [[Vanessa|Vanessa Mariposa]]. He was born as a male, but his mother wanted a daughter, so she raised Serana as a girl. He was born in [[Closer Earth|closer earth]]. He was introduced in [[Part IV - Truth]].

As Serana aged, he became very aware that he wasn't like other girls his age and never fit in. He figured out the "Vitamins" his mother made him take every day were actually female hormones. When he finally gathered up the courage to ask his mother why he had to pretend to be a girl, he was met with rage and physical violence.

Vanessa and Serana Mariposa were some of the biggest names in magazines and photoshoots. They were both considered very attractive, filthy rich, and very successful. However, Serana's forced dysphoria was driving him to the brink of madness. During a live interview to celebrate his 12th birthday and his first movie casting, Serana stood up to his mother and the world, telling them that he was born a man, and wanted to be a man, and that he would now go by the name Soren. Vanessa had a psychotic episode on live television and would try to attack Soren for ruining both of their perfect spotlights, but Soren would run out of the studio, and never be seen by the public eye again. (See [[The Mariposa Scandal]])

He would chop off his long, blonde hair that made him very recognizable, and live in the back alleys of the city. [[Kiki]] would stumble upon him while scouting [[Closer Earth]], and would offer him a place to stay in exchange for work. Soren would immediately agree, because he knew that his mother would have filed missing reports and hired detectives to find him by then.

Soren would be given a [[Synthetic Nymph]] when he joined up with the [[Black Crusaders]] by [[Conre]], who had synthesized a butterfly nymph, specifically to have illusion abilities.
