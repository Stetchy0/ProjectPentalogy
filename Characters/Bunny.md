#syntheticdemon

Noah, or General Bunny of the [[Black Crusaders]], contains the synthetic demon of a rabbit. As the youngest and newest general, he is notoriously rude, sadistic, violent, and a raging misogynist. He was born in [[! Farther Earth|farther earth]].

He earned his position partly because the general he looks up to, [[Fox]], put in a good word for him.

He hates women because he’s gay. He’s happily dating [[Taka]], and he oversees the lower ranks.
