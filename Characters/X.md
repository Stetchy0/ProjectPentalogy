Xerxes was born from a virgin angel. The angel was disgraced and cursed for having a demon's child and cast out of her clan. She didn't even try to have this child, nor did she recall ever having concieved it. There was no sign of pregnancy, she didn't feel any pregnancy, and no demonic presence was sensed from her until the day the nephalem was born. In her eyes, he was impossible. A curse to her reputation, but her responsability nontheless. She was very, very aware of what his other half could potentially turn into.. She knew he was half demon just from her senses as an angel, but no idea what kind of demon his half was, or how powerful. Despite her sense telling her to just end this infant's life, she decided she would try to raise him in a safe and controlled environment, because all life deserves a chance to be good. She named him Xerxes, in hopes that he would become a hero like the legendary angelic king that shares the same name.

Nevertheless, as he grew, he terrified her with his simple displays of sadism, and she kept her distance because of this fear. Xerxes would lack any sort of nurturing figure in his life, despite being clothed and fed by his mother. Because of this, he grew up thinking something was wrong with him. Perhaps he was sick, or maybe Mom didn't like him. She was always "present," but she always watched him as though she were waiting for something to jump out at her.

Xerxes was raised as though he were a regular human with no knowledge of his mother's species, or even his own. He could never really fit in with all the other kids in the village. He knew he was more than unique, and other kids would notice this as well. He became the runt of the village. He was weak, and gentle. His white hair made him stick out like a sore thumb, so the other kids could always find him very easily and kick him around. These kids were one day hoping to become holy knights, like their parents, to protect the kingdom from deviant peoples, and Xerxes was the perfect villain in their games.

This would eventually awaken something in Xerxes. Violence. The unexpected. Discourse, [[Dami|Chaos]], unpredictability. He would begin to change and seek out his thrills. 

His mother caught on to this quite fast and yelled at him to return to being more calm and collected. Xerxes needs to "behave like his innocent friends do." However, he now knew for certain he wasn't human, not like them. He was tired of being pushed around by them, and by behaving like them, that's all that would happen. He went directly against his mother's pleas and let this new side of him grow. Strands of his hair would start to curl and turn red. He would start punching trees and houses and walls to make his fists stronger, and to feel the rush of adrenaline from the pain in his knuckles, and the other kids began to fear him, and avoid him.

One fateful night, his mother snuck into his room at night and attempted to use a purification spell on him so she could be sure he wouldn't succumb to the evil, demonic side of him. She became extremely apprehensive of his sudden powers. She came to the conclusion that some otherworldy being had put this.. "antithesis of good" within her body to create the ultimate catalyst for chaos and destruction. If the spell didn't work, she would kill him, regretfully, but for the greater good. She wished she had done this 15 years ago, before he could fight back.

The purification spell would only put him through total and immense agony and he yelled in pain before attacking his mother out of complete instinct. The moment after he put a huge gash on her eye, he stared at her in horror, afraid of what he had done, and ran off.

The house he ran from would never be his home again, but his mother kept tailing him. After some reflection, Xerxes became less violent because of his regret. His mother eventually approached him and offered him a solution.

"If you let me finish this spell, I can save you."

Xerxes stared at her, then became completely enraged. There was nothing wrong with him. He was just growing up, just like the other boys, except he was stronger than them. She was torturing him just because he was stronger. They argued, and Xerxes eventually became so enraged that he would black out.

He never saw his mother again after that night. No sign of her, no blood on his hands, no recollection of how their last meeting ended, that is, until the knights began posting pictures of his face on wanted posters around the kingdom. 

The knights found him stealing food from a small tavern while they were drinking and immediately charged him with swords and spears. He ran in terror, weak from starvation, and confused. When he tripped, one of the knights would drive his sword through his leg to keep him pinned to the ground.

He yelled in agony. He yellled for help, but recieved no sympathy from the humans or the knights. They boasted and cheered that he was so weak. _Where's that scary power that you murdered that woman with? How does a "powerful [[Demon]]" lose to a bunch of humans!_ 

Xerxes gave into his rage for the final time and engulfed the entire village in colorless flame within an instant, burning himself too. He didn't care anymore. He didn't care. Humans were useless, greedy creatures. He had no sympathy for them anymore.

When he got up and pulled the burnt sword from his leg, he looked down at the charred corpses wearing suits of armor, and had an idea. 

There should be knights made up of powerful people like him. To consolidate power. Keep it in the hands of people that seek to harness it. To actually push the limits of what magic can do. After all, he did just set an entire village on fire, an ability he didn't know he had. He wanted more.

He would form a small, but powerful organization called "The [[Black Crusaders]]," under the name 'X,' to remove his mother's influence on his life. He wanted to be completely free of the rules, and he wanted things to change.

X would lead the crusaders and his impact on the world would be felt far and wide, for generations after his death in service to the crusades.

| Weapons                 | he likes to challenge himself to only use whatever is immediately available, such as a pan or branch, to belittle humans even more when they fail to defeat him with elaborate weapons or elemental magic.            |
| Skills                  | He is almost always training his magic and body. He is very atheletic and dextrous, and will outmaneuver anyone in a fight.                                                                                           |
| Abilities               | His magic is basically 100 or nothing because of its sheer chaotic force. His magic is nothing in particular, but when he resorts to using it, whatever form it decides to take, it is immensely powerful and deadly. |
