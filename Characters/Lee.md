Lee is the name that [[Vi]] bestows upon [[Leo]]. It becomes his "new personality." Leo associates the name with his new self and the man in love with Vi, the bad side of him, and Leo is the good side, basically. Lee is, for a very brief time, the Leader of the Black Crusaders, as Vi's puppet.

Lee is the fully realized form of the synthetic demon that was injected into Leo during his initial kidnapping. After undergoing extreme stress that nearly drove him mad (see [[Natz's Coup D'Ã©tat]]), his demon took complete control because Leo gave up. He lost his hope for escape, as well as his best friends, all in one day. 

After the Coup, Lee would be kept in a cell and take the blame for everything that happened that day. He had a planned execution date, however, Victoria saw the rapid changes he was undergoing and became attracted to them. Using her involvement in the coup as leverage, she persuaded Natz to let him live, only within a cell though. Vi was the only person who would keep him company. She took advantage of his weakness and manipulated his memories of Connor and Rei in a bad light. After a while, Lee began to fall in love with her, and confessed his love by gouging his eye out as a gift to her; he knew she liked extreme shows of passion and he wanted to give her that. She initially declined, just to make him beg for her love. This would be a common occurrence in their very fucked up relationship, or [[Situationship]], if you will.

After [[Natz's Affair]] with Sierra, Vi took advantage of his drastically changed appearance to appoint him as Sergeant in Natz's place, because [[Antoinette]] was too young for the position at the time. Because Lee was about the same height and now, violent natured, he passed as a [[Clones]] of Natz that went by a different name. The [[Black Crusaders]] were skeptical of the entire thing at first, but when Lee began his assaults upon the common people and trafficking rates reached al-time highs, the lower ranks fell into line quickly.
