Bee is [[Zayne]]'s girlfriend and a general in the [[Black Crusaders]] during [[Kieran]] and [[Dami]]'s reign. She was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]]. She is introduced in [[Part IV - Truth]].

Elizabeth Berry, or Bee for short, was a farm girl from [[Farther Earth]]. Her mother had left her at a young age to start a different family because Beth was a crazy and weird child. Beth's father hates her for this, and even more so because Bee looks exactly like her mother. She was very energetic and lively, but she was also clumsy, and unwanted around the farm because of her loud, goofy nature.

Unfortunately, her father became increasingly bitter towards her. Eventually, as he descended into alcoholism, he started to mistake Beth for her mother, and started making hostile and sexual advances. I think you know where this is going.

Her father abused her for almost a year before she finally snapped and fought back, despite his threats. He hit her in the back of the head very hard with a metal rake, and Beth fell unconscious.

When she woke up, hours had passed and she was concussed.  Her father had tied her up. She could smell smoke. She screamed for help, but no one was there, not even her father.

The [[Black Crusaders]] were raiding the town, and kidnapping all of the people to use as test subjects. A Nymph with scrappy, greyish blue hair heard Beth's screams and found her, tied up in the barn, sobbing. The Nymph picked her up and gave Beth the clothes off their back before rushing back to base with her. This is how Bee and Zayne met.
