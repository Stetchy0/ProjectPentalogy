Younger sister of [[Chieko]] and unofficial support for the [[Project Hope Effect|Hope gang]]. Despite suffering from terminal illness (which is why sheâ€™s unable to walk), she is an extremely smart kid who helps [[Chrys]] build gear the team will use to communicate. 

She was born in [[Closer Earth|closer earth]]. She was introduced in [[Part III - Hope]].

She is killed by [[Bunny]], whose death is solely to provoke a reaction from Chieko.
