Zero is the squad leader of the [[Black Crusaders]] lower ranks, and despite appearing super nonchalant, is hopelessly in love with their boyfriend, [[Rat]]. Despite being the best at combat in the squad, they do not have any interest fighting [[Project Hope Effect]], which causes friction between them and [[Bunny]], the squad overseer. They were born in [[! Farther Earth|farther earth]].

Zero is canonically intersex and finds gender roles to be confusing and constricting. Them and [[Loki]] bond over being gender non conforming, and they try to help wingman Loki to tell [[Aiko]] how she feels.
