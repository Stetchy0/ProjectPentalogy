Leonidas Dimitris, a boy from [[Farther Earth|Farther earth]], was [[Connor]]'s best friend, before and during his kidnapping by the [[Black Crusaders]]. He was [[Kidnapped|kidnapped]] with [[Connor]] and [[Pherenix|Felix]] by [[Marx]]. He is introduced in [[Part I - Chapter One]].

He was a successful [[Synthetic demon]] injection. The animal chosen for him was a fox. He was more susceptible to it's influence, partially because of his sheepish nature, and partly because of how cunning the fox was. The demon's influence had a strong hold on him from the very beginning, which made him more vulnerable to external manipulation. Connor learned that he was changing quite fast because of the [[Rabbit experiment]] that was put on both of them, and Leo's strange behaviors during the tests.

He was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]].

After [[Natz's Coup D'Ã©tat]], he is drastically and permanently changed. He takes on the name [[Lee]] as he turns into a new person.
