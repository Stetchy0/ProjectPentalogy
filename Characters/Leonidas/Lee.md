After the Coup, [[Leo]] would be kept in a cell and take the blame for everything that happened that day. He had a planned execution date, however, Victoria saw the rapid changes he was undergoing and became attracted to his weakness. Using her involvement in [[Natz's Coup D'état|the coup]] as leverage, she persuaded Natz to let him live, but the rest of the crusaders would believe he was killed in secret, and he would be kept in a cell in a secret location only Natz and Vi would have access to. 

Vi was the only person who would ever keep him company. She took advantage of his weakness and manipulated his memories of [[Connor]] and [[Rei]] in a bad light through conversations, and later on, fake evidence. After a while, Leo began to fall in madly love with her. She initially declined, just to make him beg for her love, so he [[Lost Eyes|gouged his eye]] out in desperation for her attention and love. In exchange for her love, Leo would have to submit to her completely, and Leo promised her that he would. He had been manipulated and reformed so drastically over the last few years in his cell that the only thing he would ever want was more attention from Vi, his savior. Vi made him denounce the name Leo in celebration of his new self. The beginning of their relationship was bliss to Lee, as it was mainly just him and Vi in isolation in his cell. He would begin too physically change in appearance, not just from Vi's grooming habits, but also because of the fox satyr corrupting him. His eyes would begin to turn red, and his hair would turn blue. Vi would cut his hair and teach him formal manners, further "evolving" him into her perfect future husband. Vi would continue to exploit Lee in similar ways, such as the stitching on the corner of his mouth, to encourage him to smile while keeping him in constant pain. 

After the events of [[Natz's Coup D'état]], Vi took the opportunity to promote Lee to sergeant, to get him off the hook, as well as taking power for herself, since Lee was completely submitted to her every whim. She achieved this by taking advantage of her being the only one knowing Lee was actually alive, and his drastically changed appearance, as well as the recent scientific advancement within the crusaders, to bring him forward as "a [[clones|clone]]" of Natz, who was more suited to lead the crusaders than the person next in line, [[Antoinette]], since she was quite young at the time. Because of his violent nature, his devotion to Vi, and his manic outbursts, it didn't take much to convince the crusaders that he was a secret Natz clone. Lee would apprentice Antoinette, and she would learn a lot from him and Vi during their reign.

Lee comes into existence in [[Part II - Sanctuary]].
