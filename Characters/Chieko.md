is [[Moyo]]'s girlfriend. 

Her favorite animals are ducks, and she always has some form of yellow on her. She is extremely outgoing, physically active on the volleyball team, and an overall friendly and pleasant person to be around. 

She is constantly checking in on friends and acquaintances because she wants to be what people like her late sister, [[Hina]], never got to have. 

She was born in [[! Closer Earth|closer earth]].



Element: Light

She has the power of invisibility. This serves as a contrast to her nature of constantly being there for other people. It’s to “compensate” for her vibrancy, though her power is the only one that doesn’t serve as an escape from a “deficit”.
