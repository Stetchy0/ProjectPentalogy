The adoptive brother to [[Chrys]] and Charlotte Corday. Lav grew up homeless and orphaned, but actively hid his upbringing once he became a general for the [[Black Crusaders]]. He was rumored to be cold and uncaring, and was very selective with which trainees would be his private students. He became friendly with [[Green]], who succeeded his position after he was murdered by [[Charlotte Corday]].
