Vanessa Mariposa was a very important figure in metropolitan culture in closer earth. She was known for her many movie appearances, her scandalous relationships, and was often regarded as a big figure in feminism, due to her womanly flair and proud independence from men. She was often regarded as an extremist on her views towards men.

When Vanessa became pregnant through IVF, she pushed the idea that men were all evil and she could raise a child on her own. She chose the child to be a girl with IVF, however, this did not succeed. After 9 months, she gave birth to a boy, and initially thought the doctors were wrong, and named him [[Soren|Serana]]. Soon after, she figured out that her chosen gender IVF pregnancy did in fact fail, but kept raising him as a girl anyway. When Serana was about 6 years of age, she began using hormone replacement therapy to ensure he would stay feminine looking.

Serana grew up very confused about his gender, and disliked being like a girl, but Vanessa would punish him if he did not conform to the feminine stereotype. Serana's occasional deviance from the norm would make Vanessa more and more paranoid that the public would find out what she had done and destroy her career, so she became more and more harsh towards Serana.

After he renamed himself Soren and confessed his identity to the world, (see [[The Mariposa Scandal]]), her popularity and image were forever tainted. She would be arrested, but she had enough money to bail and would hire police, investigators, and detectives to find and retrieve Soren, as he was now a missing person. However, after everything goes down and he finally is "retrieved" by [[Persephone]], Soren would denounce her as his mother and demand that she would forget about him and never contact him again. 

After a handful of years, Vanessa would never directly contact Soren again, but would go to [[Idol Magazine]] to spout lies about Soren to paint herself as a victimized mother that was driven mad by her daughter's lies and treachery, however, Soren would clap-back with a restraining order and [[Kieran|his husband]]'s testimony that Soren was, in fact, a man. This would confirm that Vanessa was not insane when she was committing these acts against Soren in his adolescence, even backed by some prescription receipts for HRT. Vanessa would be sentenced to life in prison without parole, and [[Idol Magazine]] would fall with her as they were co-conspirators with Soren's abuse.
