Io is [[Vi]]'s twin brother. They were [[Kidnapped]] at the same time, and X used their perfectly matching bodies to his advantage in his experiments. The [[Black Crusaders]] eventually learn more efficient and less risky methods of [[Synthetic Demon]] transfusion, but Vi's remains the most powerful.

He was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]].
