Leah was [[Marx]]'s [[Sylph|sylphan]] wife. She was very straight-forward and very powerful with magic. The first time they met, they sparred, sensing each other's power. They loved each other dearly and got married quite fast, then had a child together. They were planning to desert the crusaders, but she died shortly after giving birth to [[Amy]] and Marx could not gather up the courage to leave without her.

She was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]]. She was introduced in [[Part 0.6 - Firestarter]].
