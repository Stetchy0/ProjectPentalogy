Jaylo is the name that [[Alex]] gives to [[Aiko]] when he finds and adopts her.

After being abducted by [[Kieran]], [[Soren]], and the other [[Black Crusaders]], Aiko loses all memories of who she was due to the severe and traumatic experiments she was put through. 

Soren took pity on her after seeing the inhumane treatment, and helped her escape a couple of months after her imprisonment. He sent her to[[! Farther Earth| farther earth]], where no one would think to look for her. He placed an illusion in her cage to make it look she was still a test subject. This

With nowhere else to go, the runaway collapsed in an alleyway. She was woken up by Alex, who had been shopping for supplies. She had no memories of who she was, or why she was wearing odd clothes. 

Alex took in the nameless girl as his own and called her Jaylo. She works at [[Alex's Bar]], and he is very protective of her.
