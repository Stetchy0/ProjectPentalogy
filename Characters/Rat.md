“Rat”, or Anton, is the only member of the lower ranks squad who is injected with a [[Synthetic Satyr]]. He is struggling to adjust to his abilities, and has a tendency to steal anything there is possible. He is also drawn to trash, and becomes a rampant clean-freak to avoid smelling bad. There are gags about how he refuses to go outside without gloves, or how he enjoys the smell of fresh laundry. 

He was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]]. He was introduced in [[Part III - Hope]].

His best friend is [[Taka]] and he gets happily married to his partner, [[Zero]].
