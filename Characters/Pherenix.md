Felix Smith, who was for a brief time the leader of the [[Black Crusaders]], is a father to [[Dami]] and [[Persephone]]. He was briefly possessed by [[Dami|Mephisto]] while being [[Kidnapped]] by Marx and Natz. His enormous show of power earned him Marx's curiosity and adoration, as well as respect and fear. Felix, possessed at that moment, released explosive flames that resembled Marx's mentor and the previous leader of the crusaders, [[X]]. This would be no coincidence, because in all technicality, the being possessing him is X's father, Mephisto. Mephisto is also the evolution of Dami, who is Felix's son. This would, oddly enough, make X Felix's grandson, though no one would ever know this.

He shares a body with his demon, Pheren. They would eventually earn the nickname Pherenix. Pherenix is the synesthesia of Pheren and Felix. He is only achieved when both are in complete symbiosis. While it seems Pheren controls the body most of the time, its really Felix tugging the strings.

Pheren is the [[synthetic demon]] that is injected into Felix's body, and would be the only synthetic demon to ever truly co-inhabit a body, rather than completely taking it over and manipulating the user or being killed by the user. This is because of Felix's Narcolepsy -- he had better control of his mind and dream state than anyone else and could directly communicate with Pheren. (This is the why Pheren is the oly demon in which we know his name). No other synthetic demon transplant has or ever will be able to accomplish this perfect symbiosis. [[Jace|Jazazel]]'s symbiosis could be considered similar, however, [[Azazel]] was able to manifest himself in the physical world using illusion based abilities, and took advantage of Jace's timid personality to control everything they did, so their symbiosis was very imperfect.

He was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]]. He was mentioned in [[Part 0.1 - Twisted]], but was formally introduced in [[Part I - Chapter One]].
