Amy is [[Marx]]'s daughter. Despite Marx being cold to her and demanding for most of her life, he loves her dearly, as she is all he has left of his wife. She was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]]. She is introduced in [[Part I - Experience]].

Amanda was born from a short-lived union between Marx and his lover, [[Leah]]. Marx may have deserted the Black Crusaders if she hadn't been killed by the pregnancy. Because of this, Marx cottles Amy as she is "all he has left of his beloved." This leads to her having an extremely skewed perspective on everything in the world until she starts to scout for the crusaders, where she begins to put together infformation on her own. She begins to hate her father as she learns more, and vows to never use magic that she would inherit from him.
