Childhood friend and high school sweetheart of [[Fox]]. She was deaf and could only communicate through signs. Unable to hear the chaos, she was accidentally shot by guards in the mass shooting from the [[March of Remembrance]]. Her death is why Fox became a general, and is insistent members of the [[Black Crusaders]] wield gunpowder responsibility and donâ€™t shoot aimlessly at civilians. 

She was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]].
