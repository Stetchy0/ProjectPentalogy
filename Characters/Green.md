General for the [[Black Crusaders]]. Although she is formally titled General Lupus, Grayson is typically referred to as “Green” by other characters due to her hair and wardrobe pallet. She was born in [[Farther Earth|farther earth]]. She was introduced in [[Part 0.14 - Ode]].

[[Lavender|Lavender Harse]] nominated her to be his successor should something happen to him, thrusting her into the position of an interim general after his death.

Green used to be friends with [[Loki]] until one of their activities led to [[Antoinette]] punishing her by forcing her to keep her eyes open. Now she resents Loki for getting her in trouble, and she feels like her reputation is tainted. 

Despite being afraid of Antoinette, she harbors admiration and affection for her leader, and despises that [[S|Seraphine]] is seemingly closest with the boss.

She is not particularly close with any of her colleagues and typically feels ostracized, but she is more comfortable around [[Fox]] than anyone else.
