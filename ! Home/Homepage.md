The Project Pentalogy is a large, work in progress, passion project revolving around a handful of characters. It starts with Experience, (take [[Experience (Original)]] with a grain of salt, it is written crudely and is currently in the process of being rewritten.) It is created by Stetchy0 and Kozypugs.

Hopefully this will one day be fully realized, but in the meantime, it will be carefully planned and organized.

The main characters are [[Connor]], [[Loki]], [[Aiko]], [[Leo]], [[Alex]], [[Moyo]], [[Chieko]], etc. In no particular order.

Some interesting reads would be [[Black Crusaders]] and [[Anthracyllin]], for now.

This site (obsidian vault) is BRAND NEW, so many pages are very, very blank. Apologies, we are working on it!

Thank you!
