The Project Pentalogy is a large, work in progress, passion project revolving around a handful of characters. It starts with Experience, (take [[Experience (Original)]] with a grain of salt, it is written crudely and is currently in the process of being rewritten.) It is created by Stetchy0 and Kozypugs. 

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: this story is not yet fully realized in text or comic form; however, it has been generally outlined. Any and all information organized here WILL BE SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL PROJECT. If you would like to enjoy this story when it is fully realized, then do not proceed very far.

Hopefully this will one day be fully realized, but in the meantime, it will be carefully planned and organized.

The main characters are [[Connor]], [[Loki]], [[Aiko]], [[Lee|Leo]], [[Alex]], [[Moyo]], [[Chieko]], etc. In no particular order.

This site (obsidian vault) is BRAND NEW, so many pages are very, very blank. Apologies, we are working on it!

Thank you!
