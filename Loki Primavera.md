Post hope effect - Loki has abandoned her mother’s name, taken on the last name of her girlfriend, [[Aiko]].

Six years after the defeat of [[Antoinette]], Loki is living her best life. Or, the best that she could have. Given that she was born in [[! Farther Earth]], she still is getting accustomed to being a full-time [[! Closer Earth]] citizen.

In other words: getting a job. 

She started working as a journalist at a local newsroom, and did her own music gigs on the side. Loki became a very skilled street performer, using MIDI tools to build her tracks.

She used to live with her girlfriend, but after a fight between the two, her girlfriend supposedly moved out. 

Unaware this was a result of [[Aiko's Disappearance]], Loki had started dropping off lunch to Aiko’s “new address” every afternoon once her shift was complete. 

Loki Primavera would prove to be a problem for the new gen of the [[Black Crusaders]] for two main reasons. 

1) She’s a journalist. A muckraker through and through. If she has any reason to believe something is questionable, she will go digging for answers. Even as a kid, she never obeyed by the rules. If you tell her to shut up, she just gets louder.

2) She does not know when to quit. Her refusal to give up on her relationship with Aiko (despite having a very good reason to believe it had ended) is what foils Soren’s role. 

Loki’s determination is extremely consistent. When she discovers that Aiko has been missing, she gets everyone she can together to help find her. When Loki learns Aiko is now [[Jaylo]], she is still determined to heal their relationship. She is determined to find answers before ending the detour. 

She has hope things will go back to normal.. at least until [[Aiko’s Goodbye]].
