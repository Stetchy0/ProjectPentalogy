A "situationship" is a relationship, usually romantic, that is very problematic in some way. Whether it be that one partner is an abuser, both partners lie to and hate each other, or even one partner is only in the relationship for personal gain (or all of the above), situationships never end well.

Romantic examples:
[[Natz]] and [[Estelle|Estelle Ivanov]] (see [[Natz's Affair]])
[[Lee]] and [[Vi|Victoria Ainsworth]] 
[[Antoinette]] and [[S]]

Non-Romantic examples:
[[Vanessa]] and [[Soren]] (see [[The Mariposa Scandal]])
[[Antoinette]] and [[Loki]]
[[X]] and [[Vi]] 
[[Jace]] and [[Azazel]]
