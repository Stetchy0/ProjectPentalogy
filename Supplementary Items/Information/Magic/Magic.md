Magic, in its most primitive form, is Chaos. It removes balance from what is, by drawing from the energies of existence, (in both additive and subtractive manners), and transforming something in some way. The only magicians capable of true creation would be [[Celestial Beings|the two celestials,]] [[Janus]], and [[Singularity|the singularity]], because they have no tie to either realm of existence.

These individuals would be:

- [[Alex]], who becomes [[Abaddon]]'s conduit.
- [[Dami]], who becomes [[Mephisto]]'s conduit
- [[Persephone]], who is the [[Singularity]]
- [[Len]], who is the positive [[Janus]]
- [[X]], who is the negative [[janus]]
