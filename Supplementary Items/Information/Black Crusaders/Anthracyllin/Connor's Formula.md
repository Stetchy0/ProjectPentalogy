While Connor tried to submit his morals to survive in the [[Black Crusaders]], he created the most potent and pure chemical formula for the creation of [[Anthracyllin]]. He would hide the file after he wrote it down, so he could later use it as leverage, but he would end up leaving it behind because he was unconscious during his escape with [[Rei]]. 

The file would be found by young [[Dami]], and given to [[Antoinette]]. This perfect recipe would be used rarely, because of its difficulty to create. When [[Persephone]] is kidnapped, his version of Anthracyllin would be used on her to increase her ability threshold, as well as to make her sick, since she is only half nymph.
