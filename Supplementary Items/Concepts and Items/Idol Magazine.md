Idol Magazine is the main magazine company that followed the big stars in [[Closer Earth]]. It was one of the greatest and best-selling publications until [[The Mariposa Scandal]], which tainted their image greatly after they denounced [[Soren]]'s coming out. The company would eventually be bankrupted by legal fees from defamation and fraud due to the scandal.
