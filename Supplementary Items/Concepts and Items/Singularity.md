It is not exactly understood what, or how, the singularity is. 

The singularity refers to the one constant between both universes. The common denominator between the dimensions that keeps them from drifting apart. It may have existed for all of time, or it may have existed for merely one lifetime, or maybe it is immortal and lives throughout multiple lifetimes as multiple lives. There could be more than one, but it is impossible to prove. 

However, the only known constant is [[Persephone]].

Persephone, though she was born in [[Farther Earth]], has no home dimension because she was never meant to exist. Because of this fact, [[Mephisto|Chaos]] and [[Abaddon|Balance]] have affected her life much more often than anyone else in either universe. She unknowingly draws power from both [[Celestial Beings]], which is why this phenomena occurs. She is merely a half-nymph, so the crescendo of events caused by her innate ability to morph reality causes extreme ups and downs in her life.

[[Dami]], after searching for the constant for eons as different lives in different timelines in different realities, realizes that *he never had a sister in any reality until this one.* Persephone was not supposed to exist, yet she did in this universe. This is how he was able to become Mephisto in [[Part V - Balance]]. However, him harnessing Persephone in the first place is what awakens [[Abaddon]] in this timeline, because [[Alex]] lost the little bit of darkness left within him; he had grieved for Persephone, and promised that he would help her live a normal life, and Mephisto's abuses were getting in the way of that. 

Alex's ascension to [[Abaddon]] would surprise Mephisto because, in every other timeline Mephisto had seen, Alex had devolved back into a [[Death Nymphs|death nymph]] because he became outraged and used far too much magic, which forced his link to the [[underrealm]] to bring him back.
