The rabbit experiment was a test that the [[Black Crusaders]] used on [[Kidnapped|kidnapped humans]] to see how developed their injected nymph was becoming. Humans were always inclined to protect and adore small animals such as rabbits and bunnies, but nymphs, especially wild and predatory ones, would kill and eat the rabbit, even if they were fed plenty, just for the fun of it. It was a great method to test the development of individual [[Synthetic nymph|synthetic nymphs]], and often inspired certain animals to be used more often. For example, one of the most successful animals in test subjects was the Fox, as they were always cunning and clever enough to overthrow the human subject swiftly.
