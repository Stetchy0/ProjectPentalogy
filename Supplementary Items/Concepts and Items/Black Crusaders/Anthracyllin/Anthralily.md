The anthralily is the plant from which Anthracyllin was derived. It was a common herb that Nymphs would smoke or drink to get an edge in battle. It was mainly an energy booster, however, it is toxic to humans.

The first person to develop it into a dangerous substance was [[Emilio Banes]], who dried the flower's petals and crushed it into powder to kill his victims as cruelly as he could. Though, as Emilio was a human himself, he would have long term exposure, and would become Nymphan himself. He is the only human to have experienced this, and the only human who became a Nymph in the underworld. Emilio's evolution is the only evidence that the Anthralily is really a Nymphan entity rather than just a flower, however, no one would ever look into this, as no one survived to see Emilio's final moments as a human, and his few moments as a Nymph before his descension.

The next person to consider the Anthralily's power was [[X]]. He is the inventor of Anthracyllin in its crudest form. Anthracyllin was originally a powder, similar to Emilio's poison, but it quickly evolved to an injection created from smoke tar from the flower's roots and petals.
