	- Carter and Felix are collecting sticks and branches for the fire at their family cabin. Felix went with him to see the beginnings of Spring
	- Felix's sleep condition catches up to him, and Carter has to take him back. He leaves behind their baskets of sticks to take him home.
	- Carter's father warns him of the "knights" that have been showing up in their local village lately. His mother dismisses his concerns as conspiracies, and tells Carter to leave.
	- Carter goes back to retrieve his baskets and finds a note from his friend, Leo, who says he has them, so nobody would steal their finely crafted baskets.
