![[Pasted image 20250505172202.png]]"The actions and plot of the colorless flame"

The Singularity is almost within my grasp, I m sure of ’ it this time. The one thing that has the ability to make me stronger than Abaddon. The only thing that can overturn the balance. I don t know what it is though.. 

For the third time, I raise the demon Faust as my disciple. “One day, I will come back to you, devoid of my abilities in my first form, of a child. A cursed child with hair that shows my thousands of years of age. I will come from a place and time very far away, and I need you to appropriate him to be my vessel again. Damian Ivanov, my birth-name. He was completely in awe that he, and only he, would understand and actuate the origins of me, chaos. It is his life's purpose. Faust. He was a simple man. No purpose other than waiting out the war, since he was not a fighting demon. It didn't take long to turn him into the perfect tool. The war happening around him had no influence on his life, for he was too starstruck by my displays of power. Angels, demons, humans.. it didn't matter to him. I am the only being worth worship and celebration. And he knew that too. 

After I left Faust behind in the timeline, I moved forward to a few years after the salvation war. Demons roaming the earth with humans and angels, freely, but still cautious of each other. The fools. I went to a prolific angelic tribe and picked the two angels I pondered to be the most possible vessels for a seed of chaos. In my last life, Abaddon told me that my children would be my catalyst or downfall. So, I'll have two. I'll kill the one that gets in my way. Problem solved. A simple and flawless plan. The first angel, Natalia, is a talented magician. She is very prolific because she is the first angel to translate spells into languages accessible to other species. And teach them too. The second angel, however, is on the opposite side. Just to see how things go. Her name is Lauren. She has nothing special about her whatsoever.

I put my seed within them. Non-sexually, however. I need nephalems, born from spells rather than procreation. Nephalems capable of all types of magic, the closest any creature could be to me, or Abaddon, for that matter. The most useful species I could use for my scheme. Since it was a spell that gave my children to the angels, they would never see physical signs of pregnancy, too. They would probably be exiled. Anything less than angelic is a demon to them. Heh, I wonder how things would go for them. I don t have time to stay behind and monitor them though. 

Next, I checked on my body's parents. First, Felix must survive his kidnapping. I piqued the interests of the Firestarter by possessing my father and setting the entire cabin on fire. Quick, and easy. I can only imagine what must have gone through that man s head, hehehe.. This broken human has suddenly released a show of power, specifically the power he is known for, at a magnitude he could never achieve. I watched him chain Felix into a separate carriage than Leo and Carter and immediately begin testing on his new subject like a child with a new toy. 

Just 2 years after their assimilation into my son's organization, Connor would be given a laboratory to practice his meaningless ideas. I would give him a useful idea here. The time machine that my body would use to find my disciple, Faust. Connor wouldn't know this, or even know exactly how he created this device. But he would do it as my magic bids. The only useful original idea he ever had was anthracyllin, I just wish he didn't have morals. I wonder what someone who wants destruction could do with such a substance? 

About 3 or 4 years after this, Felix is now sharing his body with Pherenic, the snake demon. I say sharing.. well, it s more like Felix gets to sit along for the ride. He's too weak to actually do anything to take control over Pheren. Their name is still Pherenix, however. Anyway, I lead my mother Ameille into the woods in the form of a butterfly. To save my poor father from his anthracyllin addiction. It's a match that would've never happened if not for me. My father would have overdosed in that forest that day, haha. Idiot. He would never thank me though. I rested on a branch and watched Ameille usher Pherenix into the city, to her house. What else did I need to do? Oh! My birthday, in 9 years.

What wouldn't be without my interference, anyways. She would lose my body in a miscarriage, so I manipulated her fate a bit. Someone would still die, just not the useful one. Damian Ivanov would breathe life, and Ameille would die. She outlived her usefulness to me as soon as she gave birth to my vessel.

Strangely, I am only now able to sense my other child, the magician's. Crying in the arms of a lost demon. Some torment demon. My daughter must've been abandoned in hell by her stuck-up mother, because she should've been at least a hundred years old by now, and she was merely an infant. Her brother died generations ago. The only way this was possible is if she spent the last hundred years in hell, since time passes much slower there. I didn't need to investigate any further. She may prove useful in the future, I looked into the demon's soul and saw that his past life was full of..interesting acts. I'll see what happens with the curious pair. 

I would be soon be disappointed. The demon moves to the surface and serves alcohol to humans, with my daughter as his employed. She showed no potential and had no want for power whatsoever. She was like a contented pet with the tormentor. Useless. I killed her in front of the bar so she wouldn't become a heroic and all-powerful champion that stands in my way in the future. She will not be my downfall. I will prove Abaddon wrong this time. All that's left, is patience. Damian Ivanov is currently passing notes for Antoinette's crusaders. I will watch them closely until my opportunity to take Damian s body is apparent, and Abaddon and I will clash once more. And I will win this time, because the singularity is near Damian Ivanov this time. I sense it, and I'm sure he will too and seek it out.
