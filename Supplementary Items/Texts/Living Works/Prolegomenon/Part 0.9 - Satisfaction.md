My parents are dead.
I didn’t know how to take the news. 
They were supposedly killed in action.

It’s definitely strange. The two were once so prideful. So alive. They put everything into their work. They would talk themselves up to be such powerful entities. Perhaps, not so explicitly, but you could tell by the way they carried themselves. 

It was all so sudden. 
I was also supposed to take charge over my father’s operation.
A new responsibility. 

My parents appeared once put together, but now the only remnant of their command is with my name in the will. 

I was asked if I was shaken. 
I nodded. 

Their finances were now up to me take care of. All of my strained patience had finally paid off. This felt exhilerating. 

I was then asked if I shaken by their death. 

	Oh. 

No. 

They had all the means to achieve whatever accomplishments, and they still had the gall to perish in such a sad, pathetic way. No, I am not shaken by their death. I will not miss them. 

This will be the last time I even think of them. They are utter failures, and I shall surpass them in every way. 

-

People are so pathetically negative all the time.

They are obsessed with wallowing in their own weakness, trying to cut out once it gets hard for them. 

It’s especially amusing when they have the gall to complain about me, as if I haven’t improved their futile existence. 

People forget what I can do if crossed. But for their sakes, I graciously have been offering second chances. 

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. 

The people who once threw a fit over the idea I’d be their mayor now realized it is wiser to follow me. I made them rich and they offer their praises. 

But some attempted to assassinate me. Multiple times. They realized their mistakes when I dismembered my attackers and decorated my city with their limbs. I asked if anyone else wanted to try, but no one came. Pride was on my side.

Unfortunately that meant targeting any contender for a possible general. Some of my higher ranks kept getting killed before I could properly promote them. How stupid I was to consider them if they could die so easily. 

It was getting ridiculous. Their negativity, their weakness, their stupidity. 

It felt like I had to do everything myself. 

I’m not lazy, and I hate that I even have to clarify that. It is an inconvenience to collect pieces of trash that don’t know how to fight just for them to be picked off one by one. 

I make the effort to wear a mask everyday so they won’t fret if I collect an eye. So they’ll justify it. I do this because they won’t respect me if I let them keep their eyes. I do this for them. 

All they do is complain. I want a militia with strength. I want a militia with pride. Them respecting me is not nearly enough, but I have to not break their little hearts or else everyone will parade about how I’m a monster despite my selfless efforts. 

I must regain composure. 

I am tired of trying to make other smile. They should be grateful I smile at all. They should be grateful their lady in white is always happy. 

I cannot let my expression falter. Otherwise it will break. My skin will wither and loosen like theirs. I cannot allow myself to look as broken and imperfect as the humans I interact with every damn day. 

It broke once. 

Someone left a baby outside. And of course, because I place my trust in imbeciles, no one caught a glimpse of who it belongs to. 

But for some reason, I picked up the infant. It was a boy. Was he left for me to find, or was he forsaken? There was no note. Objectively, nothing about this child could be particularly special. He had potential. 

I adored the way his eyes looked up at me. This human’s eyes. They were a majestic shade of blue. They contrasted well with his dark hair. I wanted this boy’s eyes in my life. I wanted to see how he’s grow up. 

I caught myself frowning. Ever so slightly. 

And I understood that my life had become a much more convoluted predicament. 

I cannot break for this child. Not one bit. 

He will be perfect. 

He will be my successor. 

I will raise this auspicious life. 

But after doing everything for everyone else, I must finally begin to be selfish and do one last favor for me. 

I need to keep him at arm’s length or else he will taint me and drag me into the inferiority of those I am meant to lead. And if I’m imperfect he will be a waste. And if I’m imperfect I will lose everything.

I want to enjoy the riches of life. I need to accept satisfaction. 

I am entitled to it.
