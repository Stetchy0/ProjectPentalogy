# Chapter Two

Leonidas had to stay at the flower shop a bit longer than anticipated. His mother scolded him for just running off because she needed his help with the shop. The sun had already set completely before Leo finally made it out. He had both baskets of sticks with him as he followed the cobbled path towards Carter’s family’s cabin.

The air was very cold, and Leo had stupidly forgot to put on a coat. He looked forward to finally getting into the cabin as he approached it. He noticed the lights were dim in the cabin, and realized that they needed the wood he was carrying. _Of course! If Carter was collecting these limbs in the morning, then they definitely needed them by the night!_ He quickened his pace.

When he made it up the hill and to their door, he was about to knock, but he noticed the door was ajar. He found it a bit strange and opened the door, “Hey Carter, you left the door open-”

Leonidas froze and dropped the baskets he was holding. Carter was staring at Leo from across the room, it looked like he was tied up. He kept gesturing him to leave with wide and shocked eyes. Leo went over to him silently and began to untie him from the table as a glimmer from the candlelight revealed one of his parent’s lifeless hands on the floor, detached from their body. Leo froze and started to panic.

Carter stared at the horror in his friend’s eyes. He wished his mouth wasn’t bound so he would listen to him! He thought, maybe, if he concentrated on the message enough, just maybe it would get through to him. _Get out of here before they find you and take you too! Escape! Run! Please?_

It was no use. Carter didn’t know any magic at all. It was pointless. Leo was just stuck, panicking and trying to calculate his next move.

_This is all my fault. I should have listened to my father. Now both of my parents are dead. I just hope Felix stays asleep so that he will survive. Why won’t you leave Leo? Save yourself!_

Carter started to tear up. He was such a fool. He closed his eyes tightly as one of the men approached Leo from behind.

“Ahem,”

Leo screamed in terror and was about to run, but the man grabbed his leg. “I’m sorry kid, but I can’t have you running off and telling everyone what you’ve seen here.”

Leo began to beg, “I-I won’t tell a-anyone, I don’t even know who you are!”

“I know you talk too much and don’t mind your own business. I saw you in the blacksmith’s shop earlier.”

Leo didn’t look at the man until now, and even though he was masked now, he knew who this was. There were five golden star pins on the collar of his uniform. His eyes widened. He had blabbed his mouth too much and told these monsters where his best friend had lived without a second thought!

_This was all his fault._

Leo gave up, his spirit was broken. Marx shrugged, “That makes things easier for both of us, I suppose.” He tied Leo up next to Carter and continued looting the house. He didn’t bother putting a cloth in his mouth, he knew the kid wouldn’t run his mouth anymore.

Another voice rung out from across the house, “Who’s the kid? Must be a heavy sleeper, slept through all that racket we made earlier!” Carter shot up and started to struggle.

“Wake up, brat.”

Felix opened his eyes drowsily and noticed the man holding his body was a stranger. Someone he had never seen before. He spoke feebly, “What’s going on?”

The stranger chuckled, “Are you sick or something? How was your nap, sleeping beauty?” Felix looked around and noticed his brother and Leo across the room, tied to the table. That can’t be right, he must still be asleep. “This must be.. a dream..hmm..”

Carter was yelling through the bindings on his mouth, in anger and desperation, at the man holding his brother, the same man who killed both of his parents. The man growled a bit, “Shut up, kid, there’s nothing you can do. Tranq' them already, would ya?” He kept struggling and trying to break free, but he felt Marx poke his neck with something sharp, and he began to fall asleep almost immediately. He did the same to Leo, who still showed no struggle. They both blacked out. As Carter's eyes grew heavy, he watched the two demons rush to his brother, as he started to seize.

He felt..warm.

-

Carter woke up not soon after. He was accidentally given a smaller dose. He and Leo were alone in a section of a carriage, tied up, but their mouths weren't covered. Carter soon began to feel that he was in pain. He was covered in soot and burns, and Leo was too. He could smell smoke.

He tried nudging Leo awake, but it was no use. He was out cold.

He began to hear a conversation on the other side of the divider.

"I'm not taking my eyes off this.._kid_ for one second."
"I'm surprised you didn't retaliate. Shit... you've *never* been able to produce flames that hot, or big, or bright, or-"
"Shut up Natz. I get it. You can pick on me later. Jeez. "

Natz chuckled. "I'm gonna go steal a horse and get back to base. Have fun with your eh.. sleeping beauty." 

Natz's voice was very cynical of the other. He hadn't figured out his name yet.

"I know you're awake in there. One of you at least. I heard you shuffle when you woke."

Carter froze up.

"I'm not going to hurt you. Well.. *I'm* not,, but that's besides the point."

He kept quiet. The man replied to his silence after a moment, "You're smart. You should understand by now that you are completely vulnerable to whatever the hell I say, no?"

...

"You aren't going back home. You have no home to go back to, and soon, you will have no memory of it. If you cooperate, you will have a much easier time in the future. I only wish to speak with you for now. We can take turns asking questions, if you'd like."

Carter took a few breaths, "Fine. What do you want from me?"

"I collect human children.. for science. basically. My turn. What condition does your brother have?"

"He has a sleeping disorder called narcolepsy. He basically recovers little to no energy from his sleep."

"...It's your turn to ask a question."

Carter scoffed "Why are you being nice to me now?"

"Well, we are going to be working together now, and besides, its more fun this way. This is a long trip. Ask whatever question. I don't care. You'll forget this anyway."

"Was my father right about you knights? Do you and your 'knights' feign good intentions? Just to get us vulnerable?"

"To answer all *three* of those questions, yes. The only reason my ranks do bounties and simple labor is to get on the good side of human villages. Has your brother ever... made a deal with a demon, or angel, o-or anything?"

"What? What kind of stupid question is that? We are basket makers"

"Yes or no." There was a sort of.. fear and sincerity in his voice.

"No."

...

"What's your name?"

"My name is Marx Ivanov. Sergeant Marx Ivanov."

"And that other guy?"

"General Natz Ivanov."

"Brothers?"

"Correct."

"Of course." Carter slumped back in the carriage. The rickety wheels kept bouncing over the loose cobblestones and whining with wear. He looked between the boards beside him to watch the trees go by. Marx asked his next question, "Are your parents both human?"

Carter sat up, "What the hell happened back there? Is something wrong with Felix?"

Marx hesitated before replying, "Your *brother* set your entire house on fire with magic I have never seen before."

*That's.. impossible.*

"You're lying. Just tell me Felix died instead of pulling my leg." Carter's heart sunk as he was reminded of his parents. He choked on his tears and closed his eyes. Marx opened the door that Carter thought was a wall, that he was leaning on, and he fell onto the floor, still tied up. He saw Felix was tied up, quite tightly, and his eyes and mouth were bound as well. They were very paranoid of him. 

"I don't kill children. Believe it or not, I have a daughter of my own."

Carter felt a bit of relief. At least he, Felix, and Leo were alive, and together, for now.

"Well, you clearly have no idea what that could've been, so your question time has run out. Sorry kid. Can't have you trying to figure out where we are headed."

Carter looked back at Marx before he administered a full dose of tranquilizer, putting him into sleep, correctly this time.
