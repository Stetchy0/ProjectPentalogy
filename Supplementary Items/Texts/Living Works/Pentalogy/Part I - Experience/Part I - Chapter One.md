# Chapter One

A log crumbled underneath its weight in the furnace keeping the cabin warm. One of the children in the house, a boy 14 years old, put on his fur coat and grabbed a basket to go retrieve more wood. Winter was thawing and flowers were starting to bloom, but the air hadn’t quite started to warm up just yet.

As Carter was putting on his gloves and about to leave, his younger brother of 11 grabbed his basket and looked up at him, eager to help. Carter sighed, “Felix, I’m glad you want to help, but I don’t want you getting sick.” He could see the bags under Felix’s eyes already. Felix retaliated, “I’m sick of being stuck in the house! I’ve been inside all winter, and it’s finally spring! Can I please help? I’ll stay awake as long as I can and we will bring home hundreds of sticks!” Carter chuckled, “As long as it’s okay with Mom.” After a few minutes of pleading with their protective mother, they left the cabin to gather twigs, sticks, logs and limbs. Felix admired the wildflowers blooming between the patches of melting snow as he collected fallen limbs. He was happy to be awake, but he could already feel his eyelids becoming heavy again and he sighed.

“Carter.. We need to go home..” Carter had barely filled his basket halfway. He looked at Felix and noticed his drowsiness. That sleeping condition of his seems to be getting to him more nowadays. “Can you carry your basket?”

Felix shook his head as a lengthy yawn escaped his mouth. He could barely keep his eyes open. Carter decided he would take Felix home and come back for the twigs. He picked Felix up and left their baskets under a tree before walking back home, helping his brother out of his coat and boots, and into their shared bedroom. Felix got the closer bed for obvious reasons. Carter tucked him in before leaving the bedroom. On the way back out of the cabin, his father stopped him. Father had a sort of.. cautionary glare. “Son.”

“I need you to find that friend of yours, and.. and just watch out for each other, okay?”

Carter furrowed his brows a bit. “Is something going on?”

“No.. maybe? I don’t know. Do you remember the Crusaders I told you about?”

It took him a moment, but he did remember. The Black Crusaders. They are a large and private militia made up mostly by demons that works for the kingdom and protects outlier villages like the one they lived in, at least, that’s what their posters say.

“I think so, they’re like knights or something.”

“That’s what they want you to think.. Son, if you see any of them. Anyone that you SUSPECT is one of them, run away. You’re only a human, you can’t defend yourself.”

“What are you talking about? They just.. chase thieves off and keep villagers safe, right?”

“I wish that were the case. They just use that ‘excuse’ to-”

Mother cut him off, “Stop it, you’re going to give him nightmares with your conspiracies. Carter, go. Have fun. Be a kid.” Carter swiftly slipped out of the door before his parents started fighting and followed the cobbled path back over the hills to grab his wood baskets. He found that they were missing and groaned, before he noticed a note in their stead, “I stole your baskets dummy! -Leo.” Carter sighed in relief. He felt stupid for thinking that the baskets would be safe from theft for as long as it would take to get back home, carrying Felix. He was just glad that Leo found the baskets before some other kid did, his mother’s woven baskets were highly sought after for their quality. What was he thinking leaving them out in the open like that?

Carter walked into the village, to Leo’s family’s flower shop. The place was swarming with people. Spring had sprung, and The Dimitri’s Florist shop was filled with people trying to buy Spring’s freshest flowers for their beloveds and et cetera. Leonidas walked out from behind the counter, holding a bouquet of assorted flowers that was twice his size. His eyes lit up when he saw Carter and he put the bouquet in its designated vase in the main area. “Hey! You finally showed up! How’s things?” Carter gestured for him to come outside of the shop. There were WAY too many people in there. Leo and Carter walked outside the flower shop and stood in front of the window. Leo spoke, “Now, as I was _saying.._” Carter laughed, “I’m doing alright. Thanks, Leo. This is the busiest I have ever seen your mother’s shop.”

“I know right! I’ve been on my feet all day. Glad to get out of there for a little bit. How’s Felix?”

“He’s sleeping. Probably going to stay asleep until Mom wakes him up for dinner, then he will go right back to sleep, as usual.”

Leo sighed and spoke after a moment, “Read anymore of your nerd books?” Carter chuckled, “Not lately, I’ve been too busy helping Mom weave baskets. They're coming up to market next week.”

“I see.”

Carter’s attention started to drift off to the busy street. There were humans, demons, and angels roaming about. For angels and elves, it was typical for them to celebrate the first day of Spring as a holiday. They would give each other gifts to celebrate rebirth.

The demons would celebrate the first day of spring as it was a war victory from thousands of years ago against the angels that saved their species from extinction. They called it Salvation Day. Carter chuckled. He was a nerd after all. He found comfort in the fact that both races celebrated the day together now, as the date had become twice as significant over time. Humans were kind of just, stuck in the middle, but celebrated with them anyways. They had fought alongside the demons all those years ago, after all.

Carter noticed a group of uniformed men at the blacksmith’s shop across the street. There were two cloaked men with the Black Crusader’s emblem on the shoulders of their squared capes. They looked like they could be brothers. He noticed their long pointy ears, they were demons. Carter felt his heart drop as he recalled what Father was talking about before he left that morning.

Leo noticed Carter’s fear and curiosity and investigated the shop as well. There were a few masked individuals wearing a similar uniform, just with bird-like masks that covered their eyes and stuck out at their noses, and shorter capes that did not bear the emblem. Those two in the front must be special.

Leo smiled with excitement “Let’s go talk to those Crusaders over there Carter! I think that one is the leader, he has stars on his collar!” Carter gripped his fist. “What if.. they aren’t who they say they are?” Leo noticed that Carter had genuine fear towards them. He was trembling a bit. “Carter? You should probably go home. You look pale.” Millions of things were racing through Carter’s mind. What if Father was right? Should he even be afraid? No.. His father has had conspiracies like this before. Surely, this was another far fetched idea of his. “N-no, I’m fine. My father just had some crazy ideas about the Black Crusaders, but they have protected our village for so long, I think we should at least wish them a good Salvation Day.”

The two boys walked into the shop. Carter noticed the blacksmith was bartering with the taller one. The one with four stars on his collar. The other one, the one with five stars, however, approached the two boys and looked down at them. “You humans look a bit young to be buying weapons.. At least weapons this size. That broadsword over there probably weighs more than you both.” His voice was soft but authoritative. It was raspy from smoke and there was alcohol on his breath. Carter was frozen in place. His attention turned toward one of the bird-masked people. He noticed one with.. it took him a second to remember the medical term, *heterochromia*. Her eyes were two different, distinct colors. Blue and Orange. He read about that in one of his father’s books. Very rare.

She noticed Carter’s attention, grinned and waved before the four star guy glared at her. She looked away sheepishly. Carter furrowed his brow before Leo spoke to the man that approached them. “My name is Leonidas Dimitris and my family owns the flower shop across the street! This here is my friend, Carter, and his mom sells high quality, hand-made baskets and boxes and such from her house up the hill. We wanted to wish you a Happy Salvation Day!”

The man was a bit stunned by Leo’s chatter. He smiled a bit. “Thanks. I honestly forgot that was today. That must be why the streets are so busy… Hand-woven baskets you say?” Carter nodded and spoke. “Y-yes. It’s a weaving method kept within my family for generations on my mother’s side. My father is a doctor.”

The man smirked a bit, “I see. I might pop in and buy some. My travel bags are starting to wear, I might try some human technology instead.” He gestured to the pack on his leg and it clearly had a few loose seams and tears. There were glass items on the other side of the cloth, Carter noticed through the thinning fabric. They looked similar to the vials that his father used for medicine.

The man paused. “A-actually, here,” The man handed Carter a small, but heavy, bag of gold coins before he finished speaking. “Head home and tell your mother I’ll buy everything she has. Whatever I don’t use, my regiments definitely will.” Carter’s eyes lit up. This was probably enough gold to buy cattle and feed for a whole year! They would eat well in the coming months. “Y-yes sir.” The man shook Carter’s hand and paused before he spoke. “Pleasure doing business with you.” The taller man chuckled and looked over at them.

The two left the shop as Carter put the coin bag in his pocket. Leo chuckled, “Yeah, I think your dad has finally lost it. They were pretty nice! How much gold do you think he gave you? Can we count it at least?” Carter spoke, “No no, this is for my mom. All that hard work she’s put in through the winter is finally paying off. No one touches these coins except Mother.” Carter was proud, and relieved. He had gone directly against his father’s wishes, but it paid off, so he wouldn’t get into trouble for disobedience. He smiled a bit. “Wanna come home with me? The flower shop closes soon anyways, right?”

“Yeah! Oh, let me grab your stick baskets first. I’ll catch up with you!” Leo ran back into the flower shop as Carter started to walk home. He watched the sun’s beams on the trees begin to turn orange then red as the sun set behind him as he followed the cobbled path back to his family’s cabin.
