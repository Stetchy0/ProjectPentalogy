Spestyche is one of the largest cities in [[Closer Earth]], and is the setting of [[Part III - Hope|Project: Hope Effect]], as well as [[Part IV - Truth|Truth]] and [[Part V - Balance|Balance]]. It is a cultural hub, where people from all types of backgrounds live and visit. The city is always alive with the hums of traffic, trains, subways, and the occasional siren, etc. It is located on the East coast on a large bay at the mouth of a major river, which is the reason why it became such a large city.
