[[Alex]] runs a bar just a few miles outside the walls of [[Siverial]]. It is also a small inn, and he takes care of everyone who walks through the door. He has tended to wounded [[Black Crusaders]], as well as [[Missionaries]] and regular townsfolk alike, of all races. There are no quarrels in his bar. It is an unspoken but universally understood law of the land.

Alex had worked the bar completely alone until one day, he finds a girl while buying supplies in the city. She looked similar to his [[Len|daughter]], who had passed away years ago, because of her white hair. When he asked her name, she couldn't respond. She had no memories of who she was or how she ended up there. He took her back to his bar and clothed her, and when no one recognized or asked about her after a while, he decided to adopt her and name her [[Jaylo]]. Jaylo worked as a server in his bar and became a talented barkeep. Alex became very paranoid and defensive towards her, understandably so, because of what happened to Len.
