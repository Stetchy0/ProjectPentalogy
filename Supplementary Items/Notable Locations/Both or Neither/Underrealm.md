This is where the afterlife takes place. It is natively inhabited by [[Death Nymphs]].

It looks like a large cave with many cliffs lined with countless amounts and types of crystals and stones. Each crystal in this vast realm represents a memory of some sort, and they can be seen through the crystal's reflection. It is a quite magical and beautiful place to behold.
