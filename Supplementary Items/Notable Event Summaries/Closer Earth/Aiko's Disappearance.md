([[Soren]], [[Aiko]], [[Persephone|Perse]], [[The Mariposa Scandal]], [[Kieran]] etc)

Aiko’s abduction and the situation that results from Soren pretending to be her.

Six years after the beheading of [[Antoinette]], all members of [[Project Hope Effect|Team Hope]] had grown up or went their separate ways, feeling there was no reason to use their powers anymore. However, they were completely unaware that they were being watched by a new generation of the [[Black Crusaders]]. Their new leader, a kid named [[Kieran]], felt an extreme curiosity regarding the powers of Team Hope— specifically how [[Aiko]], a human, was able to harness enough power to kill Antoinette, who was [[Half Nymph]]. With the help of [[Soren]], who had newly acquired illusion abilities, the Kieran's Crusaders started planning how to effectively and quietly abduct Aiko Primavera. 

Aiko and [[Loki Primavera]] had been living together for two years now and were practically inseparable. However, after a financial dispute between the two, Loki stormed out of the apartment and left Aiko home alone for two hours. This was the perfect time frame to enact the plan. 

Using his illusion magic, Soren made Aiko believe Loki had come home and wanted to make amends. Before Aiko could realize something was off, she was knocked out and dragged away. Soren packed up her stuff and forged a letter that made it look like she was moving out. When Loki came home, there was no trace of a struggle- or Aiko at all.

Soren’s role in this is crucial because of how he practically dropped off the face of the earth after [[The Mariposa Scandal]], but also how he was the one who impersonated Aiko to make the group believe everything was okay. 

From Aiko’s phone, he tried to make it look like Aiko would break up with Loki. However, he felt sympathy for her, and allowed her to drop off a letter at the apartment that had Aiko’s belongings. Loki was persistent to keep communication, and feeling guilty, Soren used illusion magic to make it sound like Aiko was calling Loki.

This leads to the opening situation of [[Part IV - Truth]] where Loki has been calling and chatting with a distant ex girlfriend, dropping off food at the so called apartment in a desperate attempt to reconnect. Moyo and Chieko believe Aiko’s refusal to see Loki in person is because their relationship is over, when in actuality it had been Soren using Aiko’s phone for the past 60 weeks.
