While Kieran was the leader of [[Black Crusaders|the crusaders]], he devised a plan to violently overtake [[Closer Earth]], specifically [[Spestyche]], using [[Conre's inventions]] and [[magic]], both of which the realm would not be prepared to fight against. He wanted to utilize the "excess population" to have as many test subjects as possible for [[Conre]] to create [[Janus]], because it was beginning to seem that their greatest subject, [[Aiko]], would not be able to truly become one.

Though Kieran meticulously planned the entire invasion, he would never actually commit it, because he would eventually join [[Project Hope Effect|Team Hope]].
