([[Soren]], [[Aiko]], [[Persephone|Perse]], [[The Mariposa Scandal]], [[Kieran]] etc)

Six years after the beheading of [[Antoinette]], all members of [[Project Hope Effect|Team Hope]] had grown up or went their separate ways, feeling there was no reason to use their powers anymore. However, they were completely unaware that they had been being watched by a new generation of the [[Black Crusaders]].

The new leader, a kid named [[Kieran]], felt an extreme curiosity regarding the powers of Team Hopeâ€” specifically how [[Aiko]], a human, was able to harness enough power to kill Antoinette, who was half demon. With the help of [[Soren]], who had newly acquired illusion abilities, the new gen started planning how to effectively and quietly abduct Aiko Primavera. 

Aiko and [[Loki]] had been living together for two years now and were practically inseparable.
