While Stalix and Damian were playing outside in the longer hours of the evening, she asked a few of her insect friends to do some dances for her brother. She loved hearing him giggle with joy.

After the mantises and butterflies got tired, their father, Pherenix, came up to them in the yard and picked up her brother, "It's getting late, you should come inside soon. I'm almost done cooking."

She sighed with annoyance, she still wanted to play with her brother, but she decided she would find something else to do. She was very bored still. She ventured a bit deeper into the forest and found a large ant pile nestled in the burrow of a tree. She asked them, "Are there any cool spots nearby? I'm really bored."

The ants began to leave their nest in a single file line. They were leading her somewhere. Stalix smiled and followed them, "Thanks! You guys are the best!"

The ants led her quite far into the forest, and it was getting late. Her long hair kept snagging on branches. 

Soon enough, she made it to their destination, it seemed. There was a vault style door on the forest floor. She observed it, then noticed that her insect friends had already turned back. She was saddened she didn't get to say goodbye to them, but her attention quickly shifted to getting the vault open, which didn't take her long to figure out. She twisted the handle and the vault door fell off its hinge and into the tunnel below it. It wasn't too deep, judging from how soon it made a loud bang on the floor.
