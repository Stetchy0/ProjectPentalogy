_-Open-_

_I was supposed to die today._

  

_There was a light shining on my face._

  
  

_Was Hell supposed to be this bright?_

  
  

_I opened my eyes more, and saw the sky. I realized the ground I was on was hard. I was in a dark basement just a minute ago. Now I was outside. Was this heaven? Was that one good deed my redemption?_

  
  

_Was I going to see Charlotte again?_

  
  

_I tried to remember._

  
  

_The four of them stood with the Madame. The Fox masked one seemed confused. The Bunny masked one seemed amused. Grayson vowed I’d pay for what happened to Lavender._

  
  

_Seraphine asked if it really was me. She knew immediately, even though I was unrecognizable. She seemed to speak louder, but there was that same defeated look in her eyes from when I was still around._

  
  

_For a moment I didn’t want to pull the lever. If it guaranteed the deaths of everyone in this room, it wouldn’t feel right making her pay too._


_And then I rationalized the possibility of calatoral._

  
_The Madame would die if I did this._

  
  

_The Black Crusaders would die if I did this._

  
  

_Amaris was no longer part of my life._

  
  

_I would never see Charlotte again._

  
  

_Lav would forever torment me._

  
  

_I had nothing._

  
  

_I needed to die._

  
  

_Once we were all dead, I figured, perhaps our mortal suffering would cease, and maybe then we’d finally have peace. If we wanted it._

  
  

_I finally stood up._

_I made an attempt to observe what the afterlife looked like. I still felt like- me. I had hoped once I died, I’d be my normal self again. Instead it appeared I was still trapped in this useless, pathetic physical form._

_I saw._

  

_Tall, rectangular buildings, veering over tons and tons of people. Unnatural vessels for transportation. There was no grass. The roads were black. Once my ears finally stopped ringing, all I could hear was noise._

  
  

_I would realize that I was in fact still alive._

_Pulling the lever of their prototype was supposed to be dangerous. The odds were supposed to be in my favor, killing everyone._

_But if you know who I am, then you’d know said odds have scarcely been kind to me. I screwed us all. Big time._

_I opened the portal._

_Now trapped in a strange place._

_No longer human._

_SO I HOPED FOR A MIRACLE. IT WAS ALL I HAD LEFT._
