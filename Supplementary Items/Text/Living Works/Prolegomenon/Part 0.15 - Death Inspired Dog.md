The kid with an infested imagination.


There is no such thing as family.

That’s what father said when he buried the dog.

Don’t come back until you’re useful.

I joined the military.

It’s hard to befriend your competition. But somehow I met Tyler. Then Zero. Then, the Madame’s planned successor, Logan.

I thought I had found a younger brother in Logan. We used to spend afternoons together, playing games with Ty. Sometimes Grayson would join, other times she’d lecture us for not following the rules. Then Logan was exiled, and I moved up ranks. I hadn’t seen Tyler or the others in a while.

Things changed after Grayson returned with Logan. We thought Logan would be quieter, like the other kids who lose an eye. Now she’s the loudest out of all of them. She made a friend out there who gave her longer and brighter hair.

I told her to forget about Perse. She hasn’t spoken to me much since.

There wasn’t much to do before this. I used to build traps for animals just to pass the time. I had caught squirrels, birds, mice, but I never caught the rabbit.

The dog almost did. There is no such thing as family.

Father used to say I looked too much like mother. I don’t remember her. Father would say that’s because I killed her.

Over time I realized women are like birds. If you no longer hear their singing, you become apathetic. If you witness a stoning, the sight makes you cry. If you don’t want to hear them, they continue anyway. If you are the one stoning, they will hate you for generations to come.

It’s too much to deal with. So I’m glad I never met my mom. They’re irritating and easy to dislike. I look like a boy. And boys are easier.

Logan isn’t easy anymore. She’s difficult now. But she’s not as unbearable as General S.

-

I stood outside the door with Forest. I went to reach for the doorknob before changing my mind again. “Do I _really_ need to go in there?”

“Yes, Noah. This conference is mandatory.”

“You said you’d put in a good word for me.”

Forest took a breath and subtly shook his head. “I did. You are technically in a general position. But you still have duties, and communicating with the others is part of that.”

“This is goose shit,” I muttered. Forest’s mask was covering most of his face, but I could tell he raised an eyebrow. He doesn’t see it. “Pretty sure I’m old enough to do things without supervision.”

“You just turned 16. Give it a year, and you’ll have less limitations.”

A year’s too long. He doesn’t get it.

“Adieu,” I said, and I shuffled into the office.

There sat S at the desk. She wore the same old mask with the brightly colored eyes, her teal curls surprisingly defined today. “General Bunny…” she leaned forward. “So kind of you to finally show up!”

“Let’s get this over with,” I replied.

She tilted her head. “Get what over with?”

I straightened out my suit jacket. “Can’t we just like- do the switcheroo and then go home? This is gonna be _sooo_ boring..”

She blinked.

“I need to be aware of changes to confirm you aren’t abusing your promotion.” It felt like she was talking to me like a teacher telling a student they have to raise their hand before speaking.

“Groovy. I’m not,” I asserted. I inhaled sharply, hoping she’d hear it. “I just want an extra guard for the night shift. That’s it.”

She nodded mechanically. “Yes. I still would like to know before hand-”

“Cry me a river. I don’t have to tell you anything.”

S inhaled slowly, and her smiled faded away. “Listen, brat, you may have risen up the ranks at an ‘exceptional rate’ and all, but don’t act all entitled just ‘cause Forest--”

“Shut up, woman.”

She shook her head, aghast. “What makes you think you can talk to me like that?”

I turned away to hide my snickering. “I dunno. You just piss me off.”

She crossed her arms and huffed profusely. “You would be nothing without Forest Gauthier. That man is the only reason why you have your job in the first place.”

“Is that so?”

“Yes. Because no one fucking likes you.”

Seriously? “You’ve gotta be—”  
  
She then listed everything. Every example. With an unexpected swiftness before I could talk back to her.

“The higher ranks find it unfair you reached your position so quickly at such a young age. Logan doesn’t talk to you anymore. And you killed a few of the lower ranks in your training, so the rest have no reason to trust you.”

She’s just reaching. Her opinion means nothing to me.

“The Madame doesn’t speak of you at all. In fact, I don’t think she knows who you are. The only worth you have is one friend’s pity.” She smirked at me. “You may have a general title, but no one has any reason to respect that.”

I felt my posture drop a little.

She started making her way around the desk and towards me. My stomach slowly tied itself into a knot.

“I don’t care,” I mumbled.

“You will.” A hand grabbed my head and forcibly turned my face toward the door. “If you refuse to speak to me, I will make sure you will lose more than just your position.”

I glared at her. She leaned over grinning. “Do I make myself clear, Noah?”

I nodded. There wasn’t much else to do with the bitch in my face.

“Wonderful!” She shoved me into the hall. “Have an amazing day~!” The door slammed.

-

I took her cat.

  
  

She forgot to lock her bedroom door. I saw the animal sleeping on her bed. I picked it up and took off. No traps necessary. She was going to be very sorry.


Overheard S ask Grayson if she had been through her room. Grayson responded by saying that’s a weird ass accusation. S stormed away.

  
  

Eavesdropped on S asking Forest if he had seen a small, white cat on the loose. He apologized and said he had no idea where it could be. He offered to help her. Gross.

  
  

Some hours pass. Then there’s a sudden noise.

  
  

Knocking on my door. Banging on my door. I told her to get lost. She thrashed a sword into the door. I said if she did anything more, I’d do it. I picked up the animal and shook. It squeaked weakly.

  
  

Then silence. She walked away. It didn’t seem like she’d be back anytime soon.

  
  

Was that all it took?

  
  

***

  
  

Bunny picked up the chips of wood that had fallen onto the ground. There was a cracking hole left in the door from S’s sword. He stared at it for a while before opening the door, and quickly tossing the wood bits outside. He checked the hallways carefully. No other generals waiting to kill him. He looked both ways before stepping outside.


He still took caution for the first couple of steps before deciding that was a waste of time, and began to lightly skip instead. He continued until he heard frantic knocking, and halted at a corner.

  

There stood S in front of a rather posh looking door. She knocked again.

  
  

Bunny hid behind the wall, only peeking a little bit to watch.

  
  

“Madame?”

  
  

The lady in white finally opened the door and stared blankly at the damsel in distress.

  
  

“Please.. my cat… he…” Seraphine suddenly broke into tears. Antoinette stood still in the doorframe.

  
  

“What’s this,” asked the Madame.

  
  

“I can’t be near him-- He’s started tormenting me. He went into my room, he stole…my cat… he...”

  
  

She covered her face and started wiping her tears. “Forgive me,” she whispered shakily.

  
  

Antoinette slowly pulled her into an embrace, Seraphine sobbing onto her chest. She gently ran her hands through Seraphine’s hair, pulling apart some of her curls.

  
  

“Don’t fall apart, dear. This is something I can take care of.”

  
  

Sera gasped with fragile excitement. “You’ll help me get my cat back?”

  
  

“Of course, dove.”

  
  

Bunny would have cringed at this remark, had he not noticed the way her expression remained stoic. Steadfast- despite the way her voice seemed to comfort and warm the distraught woman. He leaned in closer.

  
  

Antoinette continued to pet and play with Sera’s hair. It looked like she was contemplating what she would say next.

  
  

“However, I will need something in return.”

  
  

Sera lifted her head to look at her lover. There was a hopeful glimmer in her eyes. She attempted to compose herself, and elongated her gasps for air.

  
  

“Absolutely-- Y-yes! What do you..?”

  
  

Sera pulled herself away from Antoinette’s embrace as her voice trailed off. The light in her eyes left as quick as it came. She stared blankly at Antoinette’s face, and slowly shook her head.

  
  

“I can’t.”

  
  

“Don’t you wan’t your cat back?”

  
  

“Yes but-.”

  
  

“Then you can get it out of the way tonight.”

  
  

“I can’t, ma’am.”

  
  

“No?”

  
  

“I’m so sorry..”

  
  

“Why not?”

  
  

Sera’s eyes began to build with tears. “I don’t want to. I’m not feeling well.”

  
  

Antoinette eyed her. “That’s such a shame.. I truly hope your cat is still alive when morning comes. You know how he is with any rodent here..”

“Madame..”

  
  

“It’s not fair of you to only come to me when you need a favor.”

  
  

“Please—”

  
  

“It wounds me. After everything I’ve done for you.”

  
  

Bunny stared, holding his breath. It was so quiet for a minute.

  
  

“..I’m so sorry.”

S lowered her head.

“I’ll help you. Forgive me for being so impolite.”

  
  

“That’s better. Come inside.”

  
  

The door closed.

  
  

Bunny wasn’t sure whether he should leave or remain in his spot.

  
  

S had never eroded that badly. In that way. Outside the realm of her usual fits of rage. Threats. Eeriness and oddities. Something about her desperation was perplexing to the boy in the hallway.

If stealing the cat was all it took to make her cry, then she sure as hell isn’t a strong woman at all. How did such a weak fool achieve becoming a general?

  
  

Bunny began to think more about it, believing he made a radical realization. Did pets make people weak? Vulnerable? Was this why father cried over the dog?

  
  

He shook his head.

  
  

It must remain the dog’s fault for chasing the rabbit. It was the dog’s fault for inspiring the rabbit to run so fast it missed the trap.

  
  

The door opened, and he saw a wavering girl step out. It closed behind her. She stared at the wall, and let the tears run toward a neck that was covered with marks and bruises. She turned her head toward Bunny’s direction.

  
  

He swiftly hid himself more, still trying to see the view.

  
  

For a moment, she remained facing his direction. Her stance was unsteady, but her gaze seemed fixed.

  
  

It took him a minute to realize she was staring at him. And it took her a moment to realize he could see her tears.

  
  

***

“Quit your whining, you’ve still got your own bed.”

  
  

“I’m nowhere near you guys! How is that fair?”

  
  

Grayson rolled her bloodshot eyes. “You’re still a general, Bunny. You’re just overseeing the lower ranks now. New duties is all.”

  
  

“So you just expect me to accept looking weak and useless over ‘_unnecessary acts of mutiny’._ What a pain in the ass!”

  
  

“Be glad you’re being moved, and not demoted or punished. You’ve still got both eyes.”

  
  

“Are you sad you’ve barely got eyes?”

  
  

She dropped the rest of my stuff onto the carpeted floor.

  
  

“Pick ‘em up,” I demanded.

  
  

“Nope. I’m done for the day. Enjoy your new room.”

  
  

She walked off, leaving me in a dreary space with a bed that’s half the size.

Great.

I began to place my stuff wherever it fit until I heard knocking on the door.

  
  

I opened it, expecting someone to bitch at me for anything at this point.

  
  

Instead I was met with Tyler at the door.

  
  

Tyler Hughes. He had bright orange hair with blonde patches because he didn’t know how to properly color it. Dressed like a total greaser except his hair didn’t need grease to look cool. He looked the same while also looking completely different.

  
  

I was hoping he wouldn’t notice how badly I wanted to smile, but he seemed overjoyed as soon as he saw me.

  
  

“Noah! It’s so good to see you again!”

  
  

I paused. There was so much I should say. Instead I uttered: “I missed you, Ty.”

  
  

“I heard you were transferred with our ranks! It really hasn’t been the same without you.”

  
  

I hadn’t seen him in months. Had it been a year already? More? And he wasn’t mad at me? I was moved up ranks suddenly. Were we actually this close? I had forgotten.. I didn’t expect to see him here.

“Is that so?” I asked.

  
  

He nodded. “It felt like it was us against the world.”

  
  

God, does he realize how corny that is?

  
  

“I know you’re like my superior and all, but. I hope we get to hang out again soon. I’m so glad you’re here.”

  
  

“I’m so glad _you’re_ here!” I exclaimed. “My transfer was meant to be a downgrade. I was basically demoted for upsetting another general.”

  
  

He covered his mouth, wide eyed, like he already knew who it was. “How do you cause one that much pain?”

  
  

I winked at him. “Threaten to kill their cat.”
