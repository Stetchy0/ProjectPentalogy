## Chapter One

A log crumbled underneath its weight in the furnace keeping the cabin warm. One of the children in the house, a 14 year old boy, put on his fur coat and grabbed a basket to go retrieve more wood. Winter was thawing and flowers were starting to bloom, but the air hadn’t quite started to warm up just yet.

As Carter was putting on his gloves and about to leave, his younger brother grabbed his basket and looked up at him, eager to help. Carter sighed, “Felix, I’m glad you want to help, but I don’t want you getting sick.” He could see the bags under Felix’s eyes already. Felix retaliated, “I’m sick of being stuck in the house! I’ve been inside all winter, and it’s finally spring! Can I please help? I’ll stay awake as long as I can and we will bring home hundreds of sticks!” Carter chuckled, “As long as it’s okay with Mom.” 

After a few minutes of pleading with their protective mother, they left the cabin to gather twigs, sticks, logs and limbs. Felix admired the wildflowers blooming between the patches of melting snow as he collected fallen limbs. He was happy to be awake, but he could already feel his eyelids becoming heavy again and he sighed.

“Carter.. We need to go home..” Carter had barely filled his basket halfway. He looked at Felix and noticed his drowsiness. That sleeping condition of his seems to be getting to him more nowadays. “Can you carry your basket?”

Felix shook his head as a lengthy yawn escaped his mouth. He could barely keep his eyes open. Carter decided he would take Felix home and come back for the twigs. He picked Felix up and left their baskets under a tree before walking back home, helping his brother out of his coat and boots, and into their shared bedroom. Felix got the closer bed for obvious reasons. Carter tucked him in before leaving the bedroom. On the way back out of the cabin, his father stopped him. Father had a sort of.. cautionary glare. “Son.”

“I need you to find that friend of yours, and.. and just watch out for each other, okay?”

Carter furrowed his brows a bit. “Is something going on?”

“No.. maybe? I don’t know. Do you remember the Crusaders I told you about?”

It took him a moment, but he did remember. The Black Crusaders. They are a large and private militia made up mostly by satyrs that works for the kingdom and protects outlier villages like the one they lived in, at least, that’s what their posters say.

“I think so, they’re like knights or something.”

“That’s what they want you to think.. Son, if you see any of them. Anyone that you SUSPECT is one of them, run away. You’re only a human, you can’t defend yourself.”

“What are you talking about? They just.. chase thieves off and keep villagers safe, right?”

“I wish that were the case. They just use that ‘excuse’ to-”

Mother cut him off, “Stop it, you’re going to give him nightmares with your conspiracies. Carter, go. Have fun. Be a kid.” Carter swiftly slipped out of the door before his parents started fighting and followed the cobbled path back over the hills to grab his wood baskets. He found that they were missing and groaned, before he noticed a note in their stead, “I stole your baskets dummy! -Leo.” Carter sighed in relief. He felt stupid for thinking that the baskets would be safe from theft for as long as it would take to get back home, carrying Felix. He was just glad that Leo found the baskets before some other kid did, his mother’s woven baskets were highly sought after for their quality. What was he thinking leaving them out in the open like that?

Carter walked into the village, to Leo’s family’s flower shop. The place was swarming with people. Spring had sprung, and The Dimitri’s Florist shop was filled with people trying to buy Spring’s freshest flowers for their beloveds and et cetera. Leonidas walked out from behind the counter, holding a bouquet of assorted flowers that was twice his size. His eyes lit up when he saw Carter and he put the bouquet in its designated vase in the main area. “Hey! You finally showed up! How’s things?” Carter gestured for him to come outside of the shop. There were WAY too many people in there. Leo and Carter walked outside the flower shop and stood in front of the window. Leo spoke, “Now, as I was _saying.._” Carter laughed, “I’m doing alright. Thanks, Leo. This is the busiest I have ever seen your mother’s shop.”

“I know right! I’ve been on my feet all day. Glad to get out of there for a little bit. How’s Felix?”

“He’s sleeping. Probably going to stay asleep until Mom wakes him up for dinner, then he will go right back to sleep, as usual.”

Leo sighed and spoke after a moment, “Read anymore of your nerd books?” Carter chuckled, “Not lately, I’ve been too busy helping Mom weave baskets. They're coming up to market next week.”

“I see.”

Carter’s attention started to drift off to the busy street. There were humans, satyrs, and sylphs roaming about. For sylphs and elves, it was typical for them to celebrate the first day of Spring as a holiday. They would give each other gifts to celebrate rebirth.

The satyrs would celebrate the first day of spring as it was a war victory from thousands of years ago against the sylphs that saved their species from extinction. They called it Salvation Day. Carter chuckled. He was a nerd after all. He found comfort in the fact that both races celebrated the day together now, as the date had become twice as significant over time. Humans were kind of just, stuck in the middle, but celebrated with them anyways. They had fought alongside the satyrs all those years ago, after all.

Carter noticed a group of uniformed men at the blacksmith’s shop across the street. There were two cloaked men with the Black Crusader’s emblem on the shoulders of their squared capes. They looked like they could be brothers. He noticed their long pointy ears, they were satyrs. Carter felt his heart drop as he recalled what Father was talking about before he left that morning.

Leo noticed Carter’s fear and curiosity and investigated the shop as well. There were a few masked individuals wearing a similar uniform, just with bird-like masks that covered their eyes and stuck out at their noses, and shorter capes that did not bear the emblem. Those two in the front must be special.

Leo smiled with excitement “Let’s go talk to those Crusaders over there Carter! I think that one is the leader, he has stars on his collar!” Carter gripped his fist. “What if.. they aren’t who they say they are?” Leo noticed that Carter had genuine fear towards them. He was trembling a bit. “Carter? You should probably go home. You look pale.” Millions of things were racing through Carter’s mind. What if Father was right? Should he even be afraid? No.. His father has had conspiracies like this before. Surely, this was another far fetched idea of his. “N-no, I’m fine. My father just had some crazy ideas about the Black Crusaders, but they have protected our village for so long, I think we should at least wish them a good Salvation Day.”

The two boys walked into the shop. Carter noticed the blacksmith was bartering with the taller one. The one with four stars on his collar. The other one, the one with five stars, however, approached the two boys and looked down at them. “You humans look a bit young to be buying weapons.. At least weapons this size. That broadsword over there probably weighs more than you both.” His voice was soft but authoritative. It was raspy from smoke and there was alcohol on his breath. Carter was frozen in place. His attention turned toward one of the bird-masked people. He noticed one with.. it took him a second to remember the medical term, *heterochromia*. Her eyes were two different, distinct colors. Blue and Orange. He read about that in one of his father’s books. Very rare.

She noticed Carter’s attention, grinned and waved before the four star guy glared at her. She looked away sheepishly. Carter furrowed his brow before Leo spoke to the man that approached them. “My name is Leonidas Dimitris and my family owns the flower shop across the street! This here is my friend, Carter, and his mom sells high quality, hand-made baskets and boxes and such from her house up the hill. We wanted to wish you a Happy Salvation Day!”

The man was a bit stunned by Leo’s chatter. He smiled a bit. “Thanks. I honestly forgot that was today. That must be why the streets are so busy… Hand-woven baskets you say?” Carter nodded and spoke. “Y-yes. It’s a weaving method kept within my family for generations on my mother’s side. My father is a doctor.”

The man smirked a bit, “I see. I might pop in and buy some. My travel bags are starting to wear, I might try some human technology instead.” He gestured to the pack on his leg and it clearly had a few loose seams and tears. There were glass items on the other side of the cloth, Carter noticed through the thinning fabric. They looked similar to the vials that his father used for medicine.

The man paused. “A-actually, here,” The man handed Carter a small, but heavy, bag of gold coins before he finished speaking. “Head home and tell your mother I’ll buy everything she has. Whatever I don’t use, my regiments definitely will.” Carter’s eyes lit up. This was probably enough gold to buy cattle and feed for a whole year! They would eat well in the coming months. “Y-yes sir.” The man shook Carter’s hand and paused before he spoke. “Pleasure doing business with you.” The taller man chuckled and looked over at them.

The two left the shop as Carter put the coin bag in his pocket. Leo chuckled, “Yeah, I think your dad has finally lost it. They were pretty nice! How much gold do you think he gave you? Can we count it at least?” Carter spoke, “No no, this is for my mom. All that hard work she’s put in through the winter is finally paying off. No one touches these coins except Mother.” Carter was proud, and relieved. He had gone directly against his father’s wishes, but it paid off, so he wouldn’t get into trouble for disobedience. He smiled a bit. “Wanna come home with me? The flower shop closes soon anyways, right?”

“Yeah! Oh, let me grab your stick baskets first. I’ll catch up with you!” Leo ran back into the flower shop as Carter started to walk home. He watched the sun’s beams on the trees begin to turn orange then red as the sun set behind him as he followed the cobbled path back to his family’s cabin.  

## Chapter Two

Leonidas had to stay at the flower shop a bit longer than anticipated. His mother scolded him for just running off because she needed his help with the shop. The sun had already set completely before Leo finally made it out. He had both baskets of sticks with him as he followed the cobbled path towards Carter’s family’s cabin.

The air was very cold, and Leo had stupidly forgot to put on a coat. He looked forward to finally getting into the cabin as he approached it. He noticed the lights were dim in the cabin, and realized that they needed the wood he was carrying. _Of course! If Carter was collecting these limbs in the morning, then they definitely needed them by the night!_ He quickened his pace.

When he made it up the hill and to their door, he was about to knock, but he noticed the door was ajar. He found it a bit strange and opened the door, “Hey Carter, you left the door open-”

Leonidas froze and dropped the baskets he was holding. Carter was staring at Leo from across the room, it looked like he was tied up. He kept gesturing him to leave with wide and shocked eyes. Leo went over to him silently and began to untie him from the table as a glimmer from the candlelight revealed one of his parent’s lifeless hands on the floor, detached from their body. Leo froze and started to panic.

Carter stared at the horror in his friend’s eyes. He wished his mouth wasn’t bound so he would listen to him! He thought, maybe, if he concentrated on the message enough, just maybe it would get through to him. 

_Get out of here before they find you and take you too! Escape! Run! 

_Please?_

It was no use. Carter didn’t know any magic at all. It was pointless. Leo was just stuck, panicking and trying to calculate his next move.

_This is all my fault. I should have listened to my father. Now both of my parents are dead. I just hope Felix stays asleep so that he will survive. Why won’t you leave Leo? Save yourself!_

Carter started to tear up. He was such a fool. He closed his eyes tightly as one of the men approached Leo from behind.

“Ahem,”

Leo screamed in terror and was about to run, but the man grabbed his leg. “I’m sorry kid, but I can’t have you running off and telling everyone what you’ve seen here.”

Leo began to beg, “I-I won’t tell a-anyone, I don’t even know who you are! I s-swear!”

“I know you talk too much and don’t mind your own business. I saw you in the blacksmith’s shop earlier.”

Leo didn’t look at the man until now, and even though he was masked now, he knew who this was. There were five golden star pins on the collar of his uniform. His eyes widened. He had blabbed his mouth too much and told these monsters where his best friend had lived without a second thought!

_This was all his fault._

Leo gave up, his spirit was broken. Marx shrugged, “That makes things easier for both of us, I suppose.” He tied Leo up next to Carter and continued looting the house. He didn’t bother putting a cloth in his mouth, he knew the kid wouldn’t run his mouth anymore.

Another voice rung out from across the house, “Who’s the kid? Must be a heavy sleeper, slept through all that racket we made earlier!” Carter shot up and started to struggle.

“Wake up, brat.”

Felix opened his eyes drowsily and noticed the man holding his body was a stranger. Someone he had never seen before. He spoke feebly, “What’s going on?”

The stranger chuckled, “Are you sick or something? How was your nap, sleeping beauty?” Felix looked around and noticed his brother and Leo across the room, tied to the table. That can’t be right, he must still be asleep. “This must be.. a dream..hmm..”

Carter was yelling through the bindings on his mouth, in anger and desperation, at the man holding his brother, the same man who killed both of his parents. The man growled a bit, “Shut up, kid, there’s nothing you can do. Tranq' them already, would ya?” He kept struggling and trying to break free, but he felt Marx poke his neck with something sharp, and he began to fall asleep almost immediately. He did the same to Leo, who still showed no struggle. They both blacked out. As Carter's eyes grew heavy, he watched the two satyrs rush to his brother, as he started to seize.

He felt..warm.

-

Carter woke up not soon after. He was accidentally given a smaller dose. He and Leo were alone in a section of a carriage, tied up, but their mouths weren't covered. Carter soon began to feel that he was in pain. He was covered in soot and burns, and Leo was too. He could smell smoke.

He tried nudging Leo awake, but it was no use. He was out cold.

He began to hear a conversation on the other side of the divider.

"I'm not taking my eyes off this.._kid_ for one second."
"I'm surprised you didn't retaliate. Shit... you've *never* been able to produce flames that hot, or big, or bright, or-"
"Shut up Natz. I get it. You can pick on me later. Jeez. "

Natz chuckled. "I'm gonna go steal a horse and get back to base. Have fun with your eh.. sleeping beauty." 

Natz's voice was very cynical of the other. He hadn't figured out his name yet.

"I know you're awake in there. One of you at least. I heard you shuffle when you woke."

Carter froze up.

"I'm not going to hurt you. Well.. *I'm* not,, but that's besides the point."

He kept quiet. The man replied to his silence after a moment, "You're smart. You should understand by now that you are completely vulnerable to whatever the hell I say, no?"

...

"You aren't going back home. You have no home to go back to, and soon, you will have no memory of it. If you cooperate, you will have a much easier time in the future. I only wish to speak with you for now. We can take turns asking questions, if you'd like."

Carter took a few breaths, "Fine. What do you want from me?"

"I collect human children.. for science. basically. My turn. What condition does your brother have?"

"He has a sleeping disorder called narcolepsy. He basically recovers little to no energy from his sleep."

"...It's your turn to ask a question."

Carter scoffed "Why are you being so nice to me now?"

"Well, we are going to be working together now, and besides, its more fun this way. This is a long trip. Ask whatever questions you want. I don't care. You'll forget this anyway."

"Was my father right about you knights? Do you and your 'knights' feign good intentions? Just to get us vulnerable?"

"To answer all *three* of those questions, yes. The only reason my ranks do bounties and simple labor is to get on the good side of human villages. Has your brother ever... made a deal with a satyr, or sylph, o-or anything?"

"What? What kind of stupid question is that? We are basket makers"

"Yes or no." There was a sort of.. fear and sincerity in his voice.

"No."

...

"What's your name?"

"My name is Marx Ivanov. Sergeant Marx Ivanov."

"And that other guy?"

"General Natz Ivanov."

"Brothers?"

"Correct."

"Of course." Carter slumped back in the carriage. The rickety wheels kept bouncing over the loose cobblestones and whining with wear. He looked between the boards beside him to watch the trees go by. Marx asked his next question, "Are your parents both human?"

Carter sat up, "What the hell happened back there? Is something wrong with Felix?"

Marx hesitated before replying, "Your *brother* set your entire house on fire with magic I have never seen before."

*That's.. impossible.*

"You're lying. Just tell me Felix died instead of pulling my leg." Carter's heart sunk as he was reminded of his parents. He choked on his tears and closed his eyes. Marx opened the door that Carter thought was a wall, that he was leaning on, and he fell onto the floor, still tied up. He saw Felix was tied up, quite tightly, and his eyes and mouth were bound as well. They were very paranoid of him. 

"I don't kill children. Believe it or not, I have a daughter of my own."

Carter felt a bit of relief. At least he, Felix, and Leo were alive, and together, for now.

"Well, you clearly have no idea what that could've been, so your question time has run out. Sorry kid. Can't have you trying to figure out where we are headed."

Carter looked back at Marx before he administered a full dose of tranquilizer, putting him into sleep, correctly this time.
