### //Breathe, A Minute//

8:30PM

Aiko Primavera stared out into the river, hands on the gate that prevented her from leaning in too far. She let the wind carry her uneven hair forward, somewhat hoping it would lift her as well.

She could’ve made it to class on time if she got dressed faster. She even woke up a whole hour earlier than usual, but she still arrived ten minutes late. She had received failing grades for the tests from last week… except for her Earth Science exam, to which she got an 86 on. She excitedly shared the news to her best friend, Emira, only for other classmates to immediately shut down her joy and state that this was the easiest exam of the semester. 

No one understood why Emira still hung around Aiko. This sentiment had been buzzing around in Aiko’s ear like a fly the past month, but today it really started to get to her. Emira kept herself busy. She was social and extroverted. She was a bit of a nerd, but she was extremely smart. She did archery club and piano lessons after school. She was the perfect student, and for a junior, she was on top of her work. Everything Aiko wanted to be, and everything Aiko couldn’t be. 

To Emira, Aiko was a childhood best friend and a family friend who she still wanted to help out. To most of the other students, Aiko was some annoying sophomore with a weird music taste whose grade average was a 70. 

Barely passing. 

And since there weren’t any teachers in the hall to tell the other sophomores to zip it, she would receive every bit of grief there was to get as she walked from each class to the next. 

Enough reminiscing about the general situation. Aiko watched the dusk get swallowed by the night sky, and she lowered her head. It wasn’t even being told the test was easy that got her down. It was her being told by her peers she wasn’t trying hard enough. And it was Emira hearing this and not saying anything that crushed her.

Miraculously, Emira didn’t have some extracurricular activity today, and invited her to go to the Spestyche Autumn promenade after school. Aiko, however, just wanted to go home. Missing her train and needing to wait a bit longer was why she was still in the city. 

The girl inhaled slowly, and then exhaled out again. Just breathe.

Breathe.

Breathe. 

“Aiko!!”

She opened her eyes and jerked her head towards a tiny fox animal. 

The critter was white with deer antlers and one black eye. It was short, but it stared aggressively at the 15 year old. 

“What the hell are you?!” She yelled, pointing with accusation and fear. “I’M NOT SIGNING YOUR CONTRACT!” 

“Wrong kind of alien! Listen- your friend Emira is in trouble!” He stood in a weirdly militaristic position.

“Emira’s in trouble??” Aiko let go of the gate that separated her from the river. 

“The entire festival is compromised! There’s a bomber who’s blowing the city to bits! You’re the only one who can help the others!”

Aiko shook her head in disbelief. “You got the wrong person, dude! I can barely run a lap in PE!”

“We don’t have enough time for your self doubt! Emira’s my friend, and she trusts you.”

Aiko stepped back. “I’m sorry. I really don’t know if I’d make it in time.”

Chrys raced towards her and grabbed her hands with his stubby little paws. There was a brief burst of light and energy. 

Sparks.

Maybe she would make it in time after all. 

### //Catch Me If You Can//

“7PM - We interrupt this program for an emergency broadcast. 

Reports are flooding in of a terrorist, leaping from building tops, who is tossing what seem to be explosive balloons. 

The attacker is wearing a pink dress, has long pink pigtails, a party hat, and an apparent clown mask. 

There also seem to be a group of primary colored vigilantes chasing the bomber. Regardless of the sights, CLEAR OFF THE BLOCK ASAP. The promenade will have to be rescheduled. If you don’t want to get blown up, STOP FILMING AND LEAVE. WAIT FOR AUTHORITIES TO ARRIVE BEFORE RETURNING.”

You got that, right? 

Was the television not clear enough? 

Looks like it wasn’t.. okay. Here’s the gist.

Moyo Bal. Chieko Lucero. Konnie Ellis. Amber Hoff. Four students from the city’s high school. They all went about their day normally, Moyo and Chieko grabbed boba together. Konnie walked Amber throughout the city. 

All four of them somehow missed the pink haired clown who brushed past them through the streets. Pedestrian traffic, some would say. 

While no one expected the promenade or festival or whatever it’s called to get bomb threats, these four blew their one and only job - preventing any strange individual from declaring war on the human race. And she did just that.

You already got her description, you don’t need another repetition of pink descriptors.

Loki stood atop a building in the center of the block that was closed. She raised her axe and called out, “what’s up swines??”

The crowd murmured and stared.

Loki clasped her hands, and grinned mischievously. ”I’ve got some exciting news! A spectacle unlike any other is about to commence!” She pointed to a balloon on top of the boba shop Moyo and Chieko stood outside of. “See that balloon over there?” 

Heads turned. Phones popped out.

“Alright, well, that’s a bomb! And if I press one of my silly buttons, it’ll pop! So to put this simply… I’m blowing up your city!” 

Before any objections or disbelief could be expressed, the balloon did in fact have a mini explosion. 

“Hey!” A girl with bright turquoise hair, dark skin, and crystal boots ran in. She readied to fire her now and arrow at the fiend above. “Party’s over! I draw the line at endangering civilians!” 

Emira Deryaoglu. Of course, no one knew this individual was her. 

She was followed by puffs of colorful smoke and lights, and suddenly there were others with her. 

One yellow haired girl. One black haired individual. One pink haired. And one red haired. This was the first time any of them had seen the rest of the others in the same setting. Some friendly banter broke out between them, and their ignorance of the clown seemed to discourage any growing threat. If these heroes weren’t afraid and were able to crack jokes upon meeting, why should civilians take her seriously?

But something struck a nerve with the clown. I thought the kid would retreat once she realized her grand plan wouldn’t stick, but it only agitated her, and she immediately set off more bombs. She then proceeded to single handedly out maneuver all five of the individuals I assigned the task to. 

I ran into Emira earlier that day, and I warned her that Loki wouldn’t be so easy to defeat. Emira said that if all else were to fail, and if we really needed anymore help, there was one person who could probably get the job done. But that would be a final, final resort. 

None of their abilities would hold out. All would have physically exhausted themselves too soon before they could properly chase the villain. 

So I ran. I ran like my life depended on it. If I had to sneak onto the train I would’ve. But I realized very quickly Aiko would’ve likely missed this train. I made a gamble as to where she’d have gone, and I got lucky finding her by the water. 

The light in her eyes had briefly been vacant. It wasn’t until I called her name that she seemed to snap out of whatever thoughts she was sinking into. 

I trust Emira. She is smart. She is attentive. She is empathetic. She would’ve made the perfect soldier. We were on our last leg. And for many reasons, I promised myself I would not let Loki Ivanov win this battle. 

I had no idea what to expect with entrusting Aiko with my energy. I had no idea what abilities she’d spur, or how her new form would manifest. 

But it was somehow the best and worst decision I ever made in my life.

### //Look Around//

“Hey are you okay??” 

The girl who had fallen raised her head to see who was asking. Amber “Amy” Hoff, but of course no one knew that was her name. She was unrecognizable due to the red hair, the brandless orange jacket, and the qualityblack shorts and boots. Amy did not dress like this at school - she didn’t even look remotely similar to her usual style. 

She was on her knees, and she looked really out of it. For the past hour, she’d been running over to pops of distant smoke, throwing her hands forward to shrink the impact of the explosion. She had tripped over a pothole two minutes ago, and she decided it would be best to close her eyes if she wanted to forget how far away everyone else way. How quiet the city was now. So she was surprised when she heard concern expressed by the bright stranger, whose boots were the only thing visible to Amy. 

“Here-“ A fingerless-gloved hand was offered to her. 

Amy grabbed it, and got a glimpse of the girl. The helper wore a cropped indigo blazer over a blue top, with a white skirt to finish the look. Her lavender hair was loosely tied into a low ponytail, and it flowed behind her with the breeze. She had bright purple eyes, and a magenta streak on the right side of her face. Symmetrical, neat bangs. She looked friendly, but she wasn’t a familiar face at all. 

“Who are you?”

The girl with lavender hair pulled over a nearby chair, and smiled. “I’m here to help!” 

Amy sank into the chair and sighed, relieved. 

“Could you tell me where the bomber went?”

Amy slowly pointed toward uptown. “We’ve been chasing her all night.. god, I think I’m gonna be sick.”

“Got it. You should stay here and rest.” She started jogging in that direction.

Amy called. “Please be careful!”

Aiko turned around and smiled. “I will!” Her smooth hair suddenly became much sharper and brighter. Before Amy knew it, she’d suddenly bolt off, only leaving sparks behind 

--

Aiko stopped racing forward when she saw another colored figure in the distance. She rolled into a slow stop, her boots somehow not destroyed by the amount of friction she placed in them already. It seemed like the girl was shouting in the distance.

“What more do you want??”

Aiko stepped closer, quietly. 

“No one’s taking me seriously!” 

She tiptoed behind the pink figure. She was gonna tap her shoulder to ask something. 

“What do I need to get some respect around here?? There never gonna see me as a —“

Suddenly, an axe was held inches away from Aiko’s face. Aiko froze before she could reach the other’s shoulder. 

The girl lowered her weapon. “What.”

Aiko gulped. “I’m sure everyone takes your prescience seriously…” 

The girl’s face was covered by a clown mask. She seemed to glare. “Who the hell are you?” 

Aiko tried smiling. “Respectfully, someone who is intimidated — contrary to what you think!” 

The clown suddenly, but very nervously, grinned. “Oh!” She lowered her axe completely. “You didn’t… hear all that…. Did you?” 

Aiko awkwardly nodded. 

The clown inhaled sharply, and turned her head away. “Gee… sorry for my breakdown then! Didn’t mean to startle ya or anything!” 

Aiko started to stand less tense. “You’re good! Are you stressed about the bombs?” 

The girl groaned, “yeah! I worked so hard for tonight to be a blast, and I built all of these bombs, and yet…” she noticed Aiko’s expression suddenly changed. “Did no one fill you in?”

“You’re the bad guy?!” 

Loki crossed her arms, irritated. “Yeah. If you got a problem with me,” she turned away, “put an egg in your shoe, and beat it!!” 

Aiko stuttered for a second, before breathing again. “Why’d you do all of this?”

Loki slightly turned her head back towards Aiko. “Cuz I have to?” She huffed. “I’ve been treated like a nobody for a long time and I…wanted to shine. Okay?” 

Aiko stepped closer to her. “I get that—”

“Do you??”

“Yeah…” she sighed. “It sucks not being seen, or heard, but you can prove them wrong someday. You can prove you’re *amazing*. Without blowing up a city.” 

Loki gripped onto her axe tightly. “You don’t know me at all. Why should I believe you?”

Aiko awkwardly shuffled. “I like to think you’re probably an awesome person, outside of all the misdemeanors you’ve committed. And you look cool as hell.”

Loki bashfully smiled. “Gee..” 

Aiko smiled as well. “Do you know how to.. turn off the bombs?”

“Maybe..”

“Let’s do that. And after...” Aiko held out her helping hand. “Let’s become friends!” 

Loki almost grabbed it, before hesitating. She stepped back. “You’re lying to me.”

Aiko frowned, confused. “What?”

“No one’s ever that nice or honest!” Loki readied her axe. “You’ve gotta be lying to me! You liar!”

“Hold on a sec--!” 

Before Aiko could point out the redundancy of that statement, Loki pounced with her axe. Aiko suddenly zapped off to the left of her hit. Loki struck again, and Aiko dodged once more. This aggravated the clown even more. “How are you doing that?!” 

Aiko shook her head, panicked. “I don’t know, I’m new to this!!” 

Loki rammed at her with another hit from her axe, and a sword miraculously appeared in Aiko’s hands, blocking the attack. 

Frustrated, Loki readied another balloon. “Quit evading me!” 

Aiko tried running. “STOP TRYING TO KILL ME!!” 

The blast from the bomb thrusted both of them high into the air, Aiko somehow not sustaining any injury. Loki continued to hit at Aiko, but the knock-back from her sword and the impact from Loki’s axe led to the two of them bouncing off each hit and higher into the air. 

The other colored “vigilantes”, following the red haired one, came out of the shadows of the buildings, and watched the clashes between pink and purple in the air. 

Aiko blocked off another hit, and bounced Loki up in the air. For a split second she thought she was in the clear until she noticed Loki literally winding up her arm mid-air. Suddenly the axe, spinning like a saw, collided with Aiko’s sword, but this time it pushed the both of them down. 

Aiko had to think fast. She felt energy inside that was ready to surge, and the sword felt like the best conductor for the job. She didn’t want to swing. But this was the only way if she didn’t want them both to plummet head first into the street. 

“I have something to tell you…”

“Huh??” Loki noticed what was happening, and her axe stopped spinning. She got a glimpse of Aiko’s eyes, which were now filled with electricity. 

Aiko shut her eyes, and suddenly a blast of lightning from her body and sword struck. 

“I’m sorry!!”

Loki panicked, yelling “wait!” But it was already too late. She was blasted off from Aiko’s electricity. 

Now Aiko was the only one falling, the back of her head toward the ground. 

Was this it? 

She closed her eyes. Everything around her seemed to slow. 

Of course, out of all the ways to die, it had to be a scenario that seemed physically impossible. Damn physics. 

This is why Earth Science was easier. It was just concepts. No kinetic energy, no mechanics, no electromagnetic stuff, none of that. Just concepts. Ideas. Rocks. Like the moon in space. 

It took her a minute to realize she was no longer falling. She opened her eyes and saw the moon above her, while she was in the arms of a girl with turquoise hair. 

“Woah!” The turquoise haired girl wobbled for a sec before seeing Aiko was awake. Relief warmed her expression. “Got you.” 

Aiko was gently placed on the ground, and she stood while all the other strangers ran toward her with their praises about how she kicked ass. 

“Precisely!” A small creature exclaimed.

All of them were startled by his presence.

“Now that I’ve found our last member, it’s time you all reconvened on your school rooftop. Tomorrow.”

He clarified. “You all go to the same school.”

Emira raised an eyebrow. “And you didn’t tell us sooner, Chrys?” 

Chrys shrugged. “I didn’t want to risk a mutiny if you all knew each other and had some grudge against me, but given that the Ace card pulled through… I think we’ll be fine.” 

Aiko, still overwhelmed by everything that had just happened, bent down and shook the paw of the little fox. 

He wasn’t expecting this, but he accepted it. 

“Welcome to the team, Ace.”

Aiko woke up on time today.
