### //Breathe, A Minute//

8:30PM

Aiko Primavera stared out into the river, her hands on the gate that prevented her from leaning in. She closed her eyes, and let the wind carry her uneven hair forward. She had wondered if she leaned a little closer to the water if the wind could carry her too. 

She could’ve made it to class on time if she got dressed faster. She even woke up a whole hour earlier than usual, but she still arrived ten minutes late. She had received failing grades for the tests from last week… except for her Earth Science exam, to which she got an 86 on. She excitedly shared the news to her best friend, Emira, only for other classmates to immediately shut down her joy and state that this was the easiest exam of the semester. 

No one understood why Emira still hung around Aiko. This sentiment had been buzzing around in Aiko’s ear like a fly the past month, but today it really started to get to her. Emira kept herself busy. She was social and extroverted. She was a bit of a nerd, but she was extremely smart. She did archery club and piano lessons after school. She was the perfect student, and for a junior, she was on top of her work. Everything Aiko wanted to be, and everything Aiko couldn’t be. 

To Emira, Aiko was a childhood best friend and a family friend who she still wanted to help out. To most of the other students, Aiko was some annoying sophomore with a weird music taste whose grade average was a 70. 

Barely passing. 

And since there weren’t any teachers in the hall to tell the other sophomores to zip it, she would receive every bit of grief there was to get as she walked from each class to the next. 

Enough reminiscing about the general situation. Aiko watched the dusk get swallowed by the night sky, and she lowered her head. It wasn’t even being told the test was easy that got her down. It was her being told by her peers she wasn’t trying hard enough. And it was Emira hearing this and not saying anything that crushed her.

Miraculously, Emira didn’t have some extracurricular activity today, and invited her to go to the Spestyche Autumn promenade after school. Aiko, however, just wanted to go home. Missing her train and needing to wait a bit longer was why she was still in the city. 

The girl inhaled slowly, and then exhaled out again. Just breathe.

Breathe.

Breathe. 

“Aiko!!”

She opened her eyes and jerked her head towards a tiny fox animal. 

The critter was white with deer antlers and one black eye. It was short, but it stared aggressively at the 15 year old. 

“What the hell are you?!” She yelled, pointing with accusation and fear. “I’M NOT SIGNING YOUR CONTRACT!” 

“Wrong kind of alien! Listen- your friend Emira is in trouble!” He stood in a weirdly militaristic position.

“Emira’s in trouble??” Aiko let go of the gate that separated her from the river. 

“The entire festival is compromised! There’s a bomber who’s blowing the city to bits! You’re the only one who can help the others!”

Aiko shook her head in disbelief. “You got the wrong person, dude! I can barely run a lap in PE!”

“We don’t have enough time for your self doubt! Emira’s my friend, and she trusts you.”

Aiko stepped back. “I’m sorry. I really don’t know if I’d make it in time.”

Chrys raced towards her and grabbed her hands with his stubby little paws. There was a brief burst of light and energy. 

Sparks.

Maybe she would make it in time after all.
