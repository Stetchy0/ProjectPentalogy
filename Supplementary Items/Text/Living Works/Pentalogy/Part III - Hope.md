Hope, also known as Project: Hope Effect is the third part of the pentalogy. 

The story is about the team of heroes, also known as [[Project Hope Effect|Team Hope]], that’s assembled by a strange [[Farther Earth]] creature, [[Chrys]], to protect their homeworld from possible other worldly invaders. 

It follows [[Aiko]], a new “superhero” struggling with her responsibilities, who falls in love with [[Loki]], a villainous arsonist clown. Together, the two build important friendships, overcome personal demons, and take down [[Antoinette]], a monarch of the [[Black Crusaders]].
 
It is the first segment of the story that introduces inter-dimensional conflict with the interaction of [[Farther Earth]] inhabitants and [[Closer Earth]] inhabitants.

There are three main “Acts” in this, along with a number of songs for certain scenes that Kozypugs decided to be a lunatic theater kid over. 

Act I
- ”1- This-Is-PHE.mp3”
- [[Aiko]] is a struggling student who is bad at almost every subject. Her best friend [[Emira]] tries to be supportive, but has become busier for the past month. Things change one day, when she is approached by a strange deer-like fox named [[Chrys]], who demands she help save Emira and [[Spestyche|the big city]] from an arsonist. Aiko finds and attempts to befriend the villain. However, [[Loki]] attacks, forcing Aiko to fight back and accidentally save the day. 
- ”2- Lets-Go.mp3”
- A secret friendship emerges between Aiko and Loki. Aiko also navigates the friendships with the other members of the [[Project Hope Effect|Good Guys]], as well as having pleasant/humorous interactions with some of the lower ranking fiends. She eventually convinces her friends that Loki should join their team.

Act II
- “4- Chances.mp3”
- Each member of the team must now get used to the addition of Loki being a “hero” and going to their school. Hijinx ensues, mostly because of Loki and the goons, but all become closer with each other, and eventually, friends. Slightly higher ranked goons attack, but Aiko and Loki are closer than ever. Despite none of the members having a necessarily ideal home life, they enjoy the newly solidified friend group… that is until all of them get doxxed during the school dance by General [[S]].
- “5- Hangman.mp3”
- Generals of the [[Black Crusaders]] make their presence known to the heroes, very clearly a threat they are not prepared for at all. Every interaction (unknown to the lowest goons) has been used to collect information on the heroes, their identities, and what could possibly have led ex-general Chrys to choose them to take down the crusaders. With peace now hung by a thread, everything snaps when General [[Bunny]] suffocates [[Hina]], [[Chieko]]’s younger sister. 

Act III 
Disc A
- “6- Romeo-and-Juliet.mp3”
- The heroes decide enough is enough, and plan a journey to [[Farther Earth]] to put a stop into this pain once and for all, utilizing the technology the goons offer to make a limited use portal device. To compensate for the betrayal of hiding his true identity, Chrys decides to search for a rumored blacksmith who will help the team harness their powers. They find [[Catherine]], and start training with her while living in a cottage. One day, a strange encounter leads to Loki running into an old friend, [[Persephone]].
- “7- Solve the Problem.mp3”
- [[Persephone]] is shunned by half of the team and believed to be a malevolent informant. She runs away, and is found and manipulated by Antoinette, who uses [[Anthracyllin]] to control her. The generals, who are already conflicted about their duties due to domestic issues, are disturbed to see how this child is dehumanized. Meanwhile, Cath is caught trying to kidnap Chrys, claiming that turning him in will protect them and serve Justice for [[Charlotte Corday]], his younger sister. A villain named Kore attacks the group, but Loki recognizes who it is and manages to intervene. General [[Fox]], who was following Kore, attacks the team, and they are forced to relocate bases.
Disc B
- There is growing distrust and infighting for the team of heroes, and pressure falls on Aiko to hold everyone together. She, with the help of Moyo, who regrets how they antagonized Perse, manage to get everyone on good terms again. They talk things out and train together. Chrys is confronted by his poltergeist, [[Lavender]], and he is briefly transformed into a human. He tells his tale before the ghost decides it’s humorous to turn him back into a fox. The group bonds together, but no one really notices that Aiko is truly falling apart. She is frustrated that her powers have not improved, and she feels like a weak asset to the team. Persephone notices and gives her a show of butterflies. The team, now in better shape, decide they’re ready to take on the crusaders for every wrong they’ve committed against their friends.
- “8- Im-On-My-Own.mp3”
- General [[Green|Lupus]] finds Loki, and privately tells her that she and the other generals will plan an onslaught on the team unless she turns herself in and gives up her status and freedom as Loki. If she tells her friends about this deal, she will be beheaded immediately. Loki agrees, and stages a fake declaration of being a spy before blowing up the main bridge to where the Black Crusaders are located. Aiko and Perse immediately call out that something’s wrong, and quickly form a Plan B for taking down the crusaders. 

Finale
- “9- Shut-Up.mp3”
- Team Hope successfully infiltrates the crusader base by inciting a riot. General Fox does not allow the guards to shoot at the crowd, paranoid about another [[March of Remembrance]]. All fight the generals and force them to yield. Aiko and Loki almost reunite until Antoinette forces Loki to duel on the [[Glass Balcony]] for her disobedience, as taking the eye of [[Loki|(Deadname) Logan Ivanov]] hadn’t seemed to change anything. There is only one entrance to it, and Antoinette has made sure none of the heroes will access it through the base. 
- “10- Forget.mp3”
- Loki struggles to defend herself against Antoinette, and is saved by Aiko at the last second, along with Persephone. Antoinette orders the two surviving generals to join her, but both turn their backs. Aiko lands the final blow, beheading Antoinette with her electric sword. However, the impact is so strong it knocks Aiko out and causes the glass balcony to shatter. While both are falling to what could be their death, Loki reaches for the unconscious Aiko, and holds onto her. Wings miraculously emerge from Loki’s back, and she manages to save her and Aiko. Loki’s wings serve to compensate for the overbearing sorrow she carried - weightlessness. 
- Everyone celebrates their victory and returns back home. At the very end, Aiko and Loki finally confess they like each other.
