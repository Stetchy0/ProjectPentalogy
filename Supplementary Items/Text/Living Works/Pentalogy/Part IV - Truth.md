## Prologue

Courage. 

You were the one who gave that to me.

All of our adventures together were unforgettable. The trouble we made and the songs we sang and the lives you changed just by being here.

You gave me courage. And I didn’t get a chance to tell you.

Now our dreams are gone. 

I’m waiting. For another chance. When I see you again, I’ll tell you the truth. 

I promise.

Logan “Loki” Primavera. Red hair with a side shave, and one pigtail. Eyepatch over her left eye. The journalist finally clocked out of work. 5pm. The sun was still out. Perfect. There was enough time to catch the next bus downtown. 

** 

“You gotta be kidding me, dude!!” 

“Sorry sir! Already got the gig!” Loki chuckled to herself, holding the phone up to her ear while holding her suitcase with another. Her soft guitar case was seated next to her.

Moyo huffed on the other side of the line. “Gig is a generous term. You got permission to busk for an hour- maybe less if there’s another noise complaint.”

Loki grinned. “Who cares? I wanted the spot!” She took up the entire back row on the bus.

Moyo sighed. “C’mon, man. We had a reservation and everything. You’re not even getting paid.”

“One, people are starting to jam along! And two, it’ll be in her window’s view! She’ll have to check it out!” 

Somehow, the Spestyche bus driver didn’t tell Loki to quiet down after each of her exclamations.

“She’s never picked up the food you left her,” Moyo mumbled.

“What’s that?” Loki put a hand over her mouth. “Sounds like the internet’s broken.”

“You better not hang up on me, Loki.”

Loki stared out the window, and sat up. “Too late, the bus is stopping!” 

“What are you gonna eat then??”

“Already got it figured out!”

“It better not be that portable microwave—“

Loki pressed the red button, ending the call. She caught herself already slightly frowning from doubt, and forced a thought that would make her smile. Everything was gonna go great today. It had to. 

She hopped off the bus, ran to the nearest table and chairs, and proceeded to unzip her suitcase. 

After a couple of minutes of setting up, she plugged in a tiny keyboard into her laptop, and turned on the amp. No crazy feedback this time! Nice!

She played some melodies and used her computer to loop them until her backing track was ready. Then the girl sang and danced her heart out.

Pedestrians came by to watch. Some recognized her as the clown from six years ago and others asked questions about her gear. She smiled, nodded, and threatened to turn up her feedback knob if they touched anything. None of them gave her any actual tips, of course, but this she was used to. 

Eventually, her alarm at 5:45pm went off, and she suddenly frantically pulled out a portable microwave and threw in a macaroni and cheese packet while playing keys with another hand. 

At 6:15pm, she finally killed what was left of her song, packed up everything, and ran to the apartment building across the street.

There was a blonde kid with glasses in the lobby, constantly checking his phone. He was startled by Loki running in, tossing him a hot packed bag of mac and cheese, and her yelling “thanks, I owe ya!” while sprinting out to catch the next bus. 

6:30pm, Loki was back in her apartment, changing into attire she thought would look cute. Would a jean jacket work? Leather jacket? It didn’t go with the dress shirt. Blazer? Then she had an idea - 

“Black suspenders.”

Loki laughed to herself, quietly. She imagined a scenario where her and Aiko went back and forth about all the ways they could’ve made jabs at the crusaders if they had a stupid name. 

She smiled to herself, sitting at the piano stool, staring out the window. It was finally gonna happen tonight. The only thing she wanted for her birthday — a night with Aiko.

Chieko opened the door to Moyomo aggressively mashing buttons to their video game. 

“Chi. Give me a sec.” Moyo’s voice still had its deadpan fry despite their physical gaming rage.

Chieko smiled and shrugged. “No rush, Momo.” 

She sat next to them on the couch, and leaned her head on their shoulder while their focus was zoned in to the screen. Bright numbers flashed across the screen, and Moyo leaned forward, chanting “IN YOUR FACE, PUNK!” Then they turned their face over to Chieko. “Yes?” 

Chieko beamed. “I took care of the rent today.”

Moyo’s blank expression started to sour. “I was gonna take care of that-“

“It’s all good! We got it in right before the deadline.”

“Yeah but. I made, like, a hundred bucks today from streaming..”

Chieko shook her head with a smile. “It’s figured out already. Now— we still picking up Loki?”

Moyo slumped back onto the couch. “Nope. ‘Miss Birthday’ finally blew us off to impress someone of ‘higher’ importance.” There was a twinge of sarcasm in their voice. 

Chieko’s eyes lit up. “You mean…? She’a finally talking to Aiko again?”

“Well, they’ve been talking, but yeah they’re supposed to go on a date tonight-“

“I know *that*, I mean I can’t believe they’re gonna hang out tonight! It’s been like, what, a year?”

“Yep. And they better make up. Otherwise I’m gonna be real upset if plans got cancelled for no reason.” 

“Cancelled? What about everyone else?”

Moyo scoffed. “Chrys doesn’t answer his damn texts, and Perse’s covering her boyfriend’s shift tonight. And everyone else, well…”

“Out of state.”

“Yeah.”

“That’s a shame. I was really looking forward to everyone being together again. Feels like last time was forever ago.”

“Time really flies.”

“I mean, it’s so weird being so grown now. I still can’t believe we all finished high school!”

Moyo rolled their eyes. “Too bad college stole, like, half the crew. That shit is not easy.”

“No kidding, it really screwed Aiko up. Speaking of- did she ever end up reapplying?”

“Last I heard, she’s doing online classes for Astro physics. Sounds like a pain. Speaking of— how was class today?”

Chieko closed her eyes and leaned on Moyo’s lap. “It was fun! We’re getting into hair cutting now…”

Chieko opened her eyes and looked up at Moyo, who seemed to be glaring to the side. “Hm.”

Chieko giggled, knowing this bit. “What?”

Moyo hid their growing smirk. “Do you really… *need* cosmetology school?”

Chieko grabbed a nearby pillow and lightly hit them with it. “Moyoooo! Yes! I’ve wanted this forever!”

Moyo swiped the pillow from her and Chieko leaned into their chest. They ran their fingers through her hair. “I think you’re already great at what you do.”

Chieko closed her eyes again, and wrapped her arms around her partner. “I got a job at the salon. I’ll get a better job once I’m done with school. And everything will work out.”

Moyo sadly smiled, and pet Chieko’s hair. “I think it’s already working out.”

Chieko nuzzled more into them. Moyo held her closer. It seemed the two would figure out what they’d get for dinner later.
