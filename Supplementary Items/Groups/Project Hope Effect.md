The team of [[Closer Earth]] teenagers assembled by [[Chrys|Chrysanthemum]] once he realizes contact with humans from farther earth gives abilities unique to the individual. 

This group was considered a “project” for Chrys to create a “hope effect” (taking down the [[Black Crusaders]]) … and a project for [[Antoinette]] to test and toy with inter dimensional humans.

The team of self proclaimed “superheroes” consists of: [[Emira]], [[Konnie]], [[Moyo]], [[Chieko]], [[Amber]], and [[Aiko]], with tech support from [[Hina]]. They are then joined by [[Loki]] and [[Persephone]].
