The Black Crusaders were an organization founded by Xerxes, better known as 
[[X]], to seek great and mystical powers and abilities, [[Pursuit of Power]], pushing far beyond anything ethical, by any means necessary. 

During Marx's reign, the public took to calling the crusaders "knights" because they often protected small towns and did jobs and bounties to gain the public's trust.

During Kieran's reign, people in both [[Closer Earth|closer]] and [[Farther Earth|farther earth]] began referring to the group as the Black Death, because [[Conre]] invented a gaseous form of Anthracyllin, which, when deployed on humans, releases a black cloud that causes infectious boils to appear on the skin, very similar to the bubonic plague.

HISTORY OF LEADERSHIP
Throughout the metamorphoses of the organization, the leadership changed drastically in name, style, and of course, the people filling the position.

[[X]] 

- referred to simply as "X"
- Founder 
- created the [[Pursuit of Power]] pretext for the [[Black Crusaders]]	
- cause attracts many people of all races, including sylphs, Nymphs, and everything in-between.
- rejects are more likely to seek out the crusaders.
- [[Vi]] is first successful [[Synthetic Nymph]] transplant because she had many perfect match organ transplants from her twin brother, [[Io]], who was killed and preserved for the purpose of Vi's Nymph.

[[Marx]]  

- "Sergeant Marx"
- planned heir for X 
- following X's breakthrough with synthetic Nymph transplants, his campaign kidnaps many children and adolescents to be used for experimentation and future super soldiers.
- made organization military
- [[Connor]] creates refined [[Anthracyllin]]
- [[Rei]], [[Connor]], [[Lee|Leo]], [[Vi]], [[Pherenix|Felix]], [[Amy]], [[Creek]], [[Estelle]], [[Cat]], [[Birde]], [[Zeph]], [[Sierra]] 
- [[Pherenix]] briefly led the crusaders under Marx's direction and Marx would've appointed him to be leader, but [[Natz's Coup D'état|The Coup]] prevented that from happening. Pherenix, now more stable and less manic, lost interest in the crusades and deserted to be with his lover, [[Ameille]].
			
[[Natz]] 
	
- "Sergeant Natz"
- second in line heir 
- staged [[Natz's Coup D'état]] to gain power, instead of [[Amy]]
- killed by his wife, [[Estelle]], after affair with [[Sierra]]. Lee and Vi take over swiftly.

[[Lee]]

- "Sergeant Lee"
- Puppet leader - [[Vi]]

- abrupt end to reign - [[Part II - Sanctuary]]

[[Antoinette]]

[[Kieran]] 

- referred to simply by name.
- Son of Natz and Sierra; next in line after [[Antoinette]]
- feared for his intelligence and power
- Last monarch to utilize [[Synthetic Nymph]]s
- finds interest in humans who gained abilities that originate from closer earth- kidnaps Aiko, creates [[Jaylo]]
- ranks become very small; people desert in large numbers because they don't think a child should lead them.
- only crusader monarch to actually work in the field while leading
- youngest leader - child prodigy
- [[Bee]], [[Zayne]], [[Soren]], [[Dami]], [[Conre]]

[[Dami]]

- referred to simply by name
- was put into power after Kieran's disappearance. 
- appoints no one; uses remaining 2 (Bee and Zayne) generals as task-doers for his own mission, they eventually abandon the crusaders after losing faith in his cause. [[Conre]] remains simply because of his curiosity towards Dami's evolution.
- also very young
- very irrational and powerful
- uses crusaders for his own agenda as he morphs into [[Dami|Mephisto]]
