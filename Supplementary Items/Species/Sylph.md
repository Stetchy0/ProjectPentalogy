Sylphs are a race of people descended from the magic that radiates from the [[aspect of balance]]. 

They are often much taller and slimmer than humans, and have wings of many varieties. It is more common to see insect-like wings, but feathered wings are also common. 

It is part of their culture to be very kind to others, and some even travel all over the world with the sole purpose of being selfless and devoting their life to the service of others.

Sylphs are innately drawn to the skies, the sun, and clouds. Weather is significant to their behaviors and culture. The sun is a religious deity to their culture.
