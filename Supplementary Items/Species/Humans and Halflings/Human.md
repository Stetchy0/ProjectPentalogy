Humans are considered what is between [[Nymph|nymphs]] and [[Sylph|Sylphs]]. They have a capability for magic, but lack any physical abnormalities. They are the only intelligent inhabitant in [[Closer Earth]], but live beside nymphs and Sylphs in [[Farther Earth]], and can even have children with both.

This phenomenon implies that Sylphs and nymphs are really descendant of humans in some way. 

Humans can be interpreted as the opposite of [[Janus]].
