Humans are considered what is between [[Nymph|nymphs]] and [[Sylph|Sylphs]]. They have a capability for magic, but lack any physical abnormalities. They are the only intelligent inhabitant in [[Closer Earth]], but live beside nymphs and Sylphs in [[Farther Earth]], and can even have children with both.

This phenomenon implies that Sylphs and nymphs are really descendant of humans in some way. 

Humans can be interpreted as the opposite of [[Janus]].

Their skin colors range from pale tan to dark brown, and, while shades of brown and black are the most common, their hair colors can naturally have any hue, depending on genetic factors and/ or innate magic abilities. The same can be said about their eyes.
