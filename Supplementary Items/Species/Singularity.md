[[Persephone]] is the only true constant between both universes. She is the key connection between the two planes of existence, and the only true unique being. Her unique place between the planes of existence leaves her untethered to them. This gives her the ability to warp time and space to her whim. This ability manifests within her early and is mistaken as demonic magic, as she used it to control insects and animals, because thats what she _wanted_ to use it for.
