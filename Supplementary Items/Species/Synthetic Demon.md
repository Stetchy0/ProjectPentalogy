Synthetic Demons are created by the [[Black Crusaders]] for the sole purpose of giving demonic powers to humans. Their creation methods are the Black Crusaders' well-kept secret - They inject demonic blood into various animals to create unique powers. They discovered that every living thing in their plane of existence has at least a small amount of magical ability, and injecting them with highly potent demonic blood brings out that ability, but kills them in the process. However, after the animal has synthesized with the demonic blood, it's own blood can transfer powerful abilities to humans through another injection, and significantly fostered by [[Anthracyllin]].![[Synthetic demons.png]]

Unbeknownst to the Crusaders, not only did they create injectable abilities, they created bodiless, conscious demons that desperately try to take control of the bodies they inhabit. When the demons gained control of their host, they inherit the host's memories and behaviors, however, they would slowly notice that they were not themselves. Some even rename themselves, not exactly understanding that they had become the demon that inhabits them. It behaves like a slow infection to the host, and slowly takes them over. Most of them end up manic and unstable if they are not killed first.

This is not always the case though, as each synthetic demon is distinct. For example, [[Soren]]'s demon, a butterfly, is extremely weak, and its abilities are completely non-physical. It manifests itself *within* Soren as an attachment to butterflies, rather than completely overthrowing him, like the fox demon within [[Lee]].

Vi is the only one to receive a true synthetic demon, as her demon was derived from her brother. She was the first, and most powerful, successful synthesis. However, she does not have any flashy abilities like the others. She was given eternal youth and rapid healing by the transfusion, which is handy but, in X's eyes, not useful enough. The specific and risky methods required to create one like Vi's is what inspired the use of animals in demon synthetization, which proved much more successful.

Another anomalous reaction to the injected demon would not only be overpowering it, but noticing it as an intruder and killing it. This can only be done by excessively intelligent individuals, like [[Connor]] and [[Chrys|Chrysanthemum]], the only two people who accomplished this feat.

One more interesting find with the injected demons is what occurs when they are added to dead bodies. Bodies no longer inhabited. The only three successful injections of this type are [[Cat]], [[Birde]], and [[Zeph]]. They are very strange in character and are completely without any memory of whoever inhabited their bodies before them. They give off uncanny valley effect to everyone around them, because they physically do not understand how to be people, and are eventually completely alienated because of this.
