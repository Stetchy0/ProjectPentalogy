Janus, though they are very much a real and very rare race, are considered myth by the inhabitants of [[Farther Earth]]. They are a "theoretical" perfect cross between [[Satyr|Satyrs]] and [[Sylph|Sylphs]] that talented magicians seek out, in hopes that they could somehow learn how they can harness all types of magic.

[[Mephisto]] is the father of the only two Janus in existence, [[X]] and [[Len]]. He learned, somehow, that they have to be created with an ancient spell, and be born from a Sylphic mother and Satyran father. He made them for the sole purpose of enacting chaos upon farther earth, as catalysts for upsetting balance between the dimensions.
