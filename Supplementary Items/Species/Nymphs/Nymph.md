Nymphs are a race exclusive to [[Farther Earth]], similar to [[Sylph|Sylphs]], despite being considered the opposite of them. They are often similar to humans, except horned and with various animal features. It is not uncommon for nymphs to be very similar to humans, aside from horns of some fashion and maybe a tail. More powerful nymphs can have more exaggerated features, such as longer horns, wings, varying animal limbs, and sometimes, extra limbs. However, these are very rare.

Nymphs are innately tied to the Earth and Nature. Trees and animals are sacred to their culture, and are worshipped by some. [[Aranyani]] nymphs even more so.
