Death [[Nymph]]s are a variety of nymph that reside exclusively in the [[Underrealm]]. All souls exist within this place, near the edge of both realms of existence, though, is directly tied to [[Farther Earth]]. It is not exactly known where they come from, or how they are created, but they are considered guardians of the afterlife. 

Because the Underrealm consists of every person who has ever died, there are some unruly souls that try to find their way back to Earth, or try to hurt other souls. Some death nymphs have to keep these souls in line indefinitely, or until they fall in line.

While all nymphs are bound to nature in some way, death nymphs are linked to the underrealm, and are permanently bound to it, with the exception or [[Alex|Al Ek-che]]. The death nymphs, as they age, begin to turn to stones of various types. The most common would be obsidian or coal, but granites, marble, and various crystal types are not uncommon.

Because these nymphs are tied to the underrealm, most people in farther earth have no idea they exist, even though there is evidence of life within each stone and pebble on the planet. There is ancient art of sylphs "born from mountains and volcanoes," however, these are interpreted as myth.

The death nymphs speak [[Old Nymphic]], a language originating from the primitive nymphs from the days of creation, before the realm even existed. The ones that choose to interact with souls have learned English over the millennia, however, they still use the language, if only for naming their children. Some isolated groups of death nymphs, however, still use it as their primary method of communication.
