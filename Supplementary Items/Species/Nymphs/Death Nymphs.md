Death [[Nymph]]s are a variety of nymph that reside in the [[Underrealm]]. All souls exist within this place, near the edge of both realms of existence. It is not exactly known where they come from, or how they are created, but they are considered guardians of the afterlife. 

Because the Underrealm consists of every person who has ever died, there are some unruly souls that try to find their way back to Earth, or try to hurt other souls. Some death nymphs have to keep these souls in line indefinitely, or when they fall in line.
