Satyrs are a race exclusive to [[Farther Earth]], similar to [[Sylph|Sylphs]]. They are often similar to humans, except horned and with various animal features. It is not uncommon for Satyrs to be very similar to humans, aside from horns of some fashion and maybe a tail. More powerful satyrs can have more exaggerated features, such as longer horns, wings, varying animal limbs, and sometimes, extra limbs. However, these are very rare.

Satyrs are innately tied to the Earth and Nature. Trees and animals are sacred to their culture, and are worshipped by some. [[Aranyani]] Satyrs even more so.
